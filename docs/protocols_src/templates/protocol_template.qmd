# Buffers used (defined in separate buffer protocols)

This protocol uses the following buffers.  
Insert only the IDs and short names; do **not** define the buffer compositions here.

- **<Buffer Name 1>** – `<BUF-XXX-XXX-vX.X>`
- **<Buffer Name 2>** – `<BUF-XXX-XXX-vX.X>`
- **<Buffer Name 3>** – `<BUF-XXX-XXX-vX.X>`

Each buffer must have its own dedicated buffer file in `protocols_src/buffers/`.
