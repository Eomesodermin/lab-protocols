Work with live LCMV must:\n\nBe conducted under the appropriate institutional biosafety level (typically BSL-2 with additional local conditions) and approved animal and biosafety protocols.\nUse dedicated infectious CO₂ incubators and clearly labelled containment for all cultures and waste.\nInclude suitable PPE (lab coat/gown, gloves, eye protection as appropriate) and measures to avoid sharps injuries, aerosol formation, and spills.\nExclude or take special precautions for pregnant or immunocompromised personnel according to institutional policies.\n\nAll waste (liquid and solid) must be inactivated according to local regulations (e.g. chemical disinfection and/or autoclaving) before disposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple\n\nTotal RNA is isolated from serum or homogenized tissue.\ncDNA is generated using SuperScript III and a gene-specific primer (GP-R).\nqPCR is performed with SYBR Green detection using GP-specific primers (GP-F and GP-R).\nAbsolute viral RNA copy numbers are calculated from a plasmid standard curve containing the LCMV GP gene (e.g. pSG5-GP).\n\n\n\nSample Types\n\nSerum (typically 50 uL per sample).\nTissue homogenates:\n\nSpleen: 10 mg\nLiver: 50 mg\nKidney: 50 mg\nBrain: 50 mg\nLymph node: 5 mg\n\n\nAll values are taken from the Methods section of McCausland & Crotty. Samples were snap-frozen on dry ice at harvest and stored at -80 C until RNA extraction.\n\n\nReagents and Consumables\n\nLCMV-infected mouse tissues or serum.\nRNAqueous Mini Kit (Ambion) or equivalent silica spin-column RNA kit.\nSuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).\niTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) or similar SYBR Green master mix with ROX passive reference.\nGene-specific primers (see below).\nPlasmid standard containing the LCMV GP gene (e.g. pSG5-GP).\nNuclease-free water.\n1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n0.2 mL PCR tubes or 96-well qPCR plates with optical seals.\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\nTissue homogenizer (e.g. Tissuemiser or similar rotor-stator homogenizer).\nMicrocentrifuge (refrigerated).\nClass II biosafety cabinet or laminar flow hood.\nqPCR instrument capable of SYBR Green detection (e.g. ABI GeneAmp 5700 or equivalent).\nStandard laboratory pipettes and filtered tips.\n-80 C freezer.\n\n\n\nPrimers\nAll primer sequences are taken from the “LCMV viral load quantitative PCR (QPCR)” Methods section.\nRecommended GP primers (optimized set):\n\nGP-F (S 877–901):\nCATTCACCTGGACTTTGTCAGACTC\nGP-R (S 970–991):\nGCAACTGCTGTGTTCCCGAAAC\n\nAlternative NP-based primer sets (historical, not recommended for new assays):\n\nNP2-F (S 2601–2623):\nCAGAAATGTTGATGCTGGACTGC\nNP2-R (S 2697–2720):\nCAGACCTTGGCTTGCTTTACACAG\n\nUse GP-F and GP-R for all new experiments unless you have a specific reason to reproduce NP-based data.\n\n\nPrimer Stocks\n\nPrepare 100 uM stocks of GP-F and GP-R in nuclease-free water.\nPrepare 10 uM working stocks for routine use.\n\n\n\nSample Collection\n\nSerum\n\nCollect whole blood via retro-orbital bleed under appropriate anesthesia (e.g. isoflurane).\nUse heparinized capillary tubes.\nTransfer to 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge 20 min at 12,000 g, 4 C.\nAliquot serum (minimum 50 uL) and store at -80 C.\n\nTissues\n\nHarvest tissues with sterile instruments.\nWipe instruments with 70 percent ethanol between mice and always process uninfected controls first.\nFor qPCR, immediately snap-freeze small tissue pieces on dry ice.\nStore at -80 C.\n\n\n\n\nRNA Isolation\nBased on RNAqueous Mini Kit usage:\n\nThaw serum or tissue on ice.\nFor serum:\n\nUse 50 uL serum directly in the kit lysis buffer according to manufacturer instructions.\n\nFor tissues:\n\nWeigh 5–50 mg tissue into appropriate tubes.\nAdd lysis buffer from the RNAqueous kit.\nHomogenize thoroughly with a rotor-stator homogenizer.\n\nCritical decontamination step for homogenizer between samples:\n\nWash once with PBS.\nWash once with 10 percent bleach.\nWash once again with PBS.\nDo not rely on ethanol + PBS alone; this was reported as insufficient to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nProceed with the RNAqueous spin-column protocol.\nElute RNA in 20 uL nuclease-free water.\nStore RNA at -80 C until use.\n\n\n\ncDNA Synthesis (Reverse Transcription)\nUsing SuperScript III and gene-specific priming:\n\nFor each sample, set up a 20 uL RT reaction containing:\n\n10 uL RNA (from the 20 uL eluate).\n1 gene-specific primer (usually GP-R at 0.5–1 uM final).\ndNTPs (as supplied or 0.5 mM each).\nReaction buffer and DTT per SuperScript III instructions.\nSuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (as per manufacturer recommendation, often 200 U per reaction).\n\nIncubate:\n\n55 C for 60 min (50 C can also be used but 55 C is preferred in the paper for specificity).\nThen inactivate at 70 C for 15 min or according to kit instructions.\n\nInclude:\n\nAt least two tissue-matched RNA samples from uninfected mice (negative controls).\nNo-template control (water instead of RNA).\n\nStore cDNA at -20 C if not used immediately.\n\n\n\nqPCR Reaction Setup\nStandard reaction (25 uL total volume):\n\n5 uL cDNA template.\n12.5 uL iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (2x).\n0.5 uL GP-F (10 uM; final 0.2 uM).\n0.5 uL GP-R (10 uM; final 0.2 uM).\n6.5 uL nuclease-free water.\n\nNotes: - 50 uL reactions can also be used; scale reagents proportionally. - Prepare a master mix for all wells to minimise pipetting error. - Run all samples in duplicate.\n\n\nqPCR Cycling Conditions\nOn ABI GeneAmp 5700 or similar:\n\nInitial denaturation: 95 C, 3 min (or per master mix recommendations).\n40 cycles of:\n\n95 C, 15 s\n60 C, 30 s (combined annealing/extension; fluorescence read step)\n\n\nAfter amplification, perform a melt-curve analysis to verify a single specific product.\n\n\nPlasmid Standard Curve\n\nUse a plasmid containing the LCMV GP gene (e.g. pSG5-GP).\nLinearize the plasmid with an appropriate restriction enzyme.\nQuantify DNA by gel electrophoresis against known DNA standards.\nConvert mass to copy number using molecular weight.\nPrepare 10-fold serial dilutions covering the desired range (e.g. 10^7 to 10^0 genome copies per reaction).\nAliquot each dilution and store at -80 C (single-use aliquots).\nIn every run:\n\nThaw a fresh aliquot series.\nRun each standard in duplicate.\n\nGenerate a Ct vs log10(copy number) standard curve; R^2 should typically be &gt; 0.98.\n\n\n\nData Analysis\n\nFor each plate, fit a linear regression of Ct versus log10(copy number) using the plasmid standards.\nFor each sample, convert Ct to copy number using the standard curve.\nCorrect for:\n\nFraction of RNA used (10 uL of 20 uL).\nVolume or mass of starting material.\n\nReport viral load as:\n\nLCMV RNA copies per mL serum, or\nLCMV RNA copies per mg tissue.\n\nLimit of detection:\n\nThe assay reproducibly detects approximately 1–5 LCMV genomes per qPCR reaction.\nIn practice, set a Ct cutoff at 35–36 cycles; values above this should be considered below detection limit or flagged as unreliable.\n\nUse negative controls (uninfected tissue and no-template wells) to define background; any sample with signal overlapping control levels should be treated as negative.\n\n\n\nControls and QC\nInclude in every run:\n\nNo-template controls (water instead of cDNA).\nAt least two uninfected control tissue samples per tissue type.\nA positive control cDNA sample from a known LCMV-positive tissue.\nFull plasmid standard curve.\n\nCheck:\n\nSingle peak in melt curve for all positive wells.\nNo amplification in no-template controls within the Ct window used for positivity.\n\n\n\nNotes and Tips\n\nWork in a laminar flow hood where possible; use UV decontamination between runs.\nHandle plasmid standards last and avoid placing them adjacent to unknown samples on the plate.\nFor very high viral loads, a 1:200 dilution of cDNA may be required to bring Ct values into the dynamic range of the standard curve.\n\n\n\nSafety considerations\n\nConfirm that all work with LCMV and infected animals/samples is covered by approved biosafety and animal use protocols.\nPerform all live-virus manipulations (thawing virus stocks, infection steps, handling of unfixed plates) in a certified Class II biosafety cabinet.\nUse dedicated infectious incubators and clearly label plates, flasks, and waste containers with the virus strain and date.\nWear appropriate PPE at all times (lab coat/gown, gloves, eye/face protection as required).\nDecontaminate all liquid waste (e.g. with freshly prepared bleach) before disposal. Solid waste (tips, plates, tubes) must be autoclaved or otherwise inactivated according to institutional guidelines.\nOPD and its solutions are handled as chemical hazardous waste; follow chemical safety rules in addition to biosafety rules.\nPregnant or immunocompromised personnel should not work with LCMV unless explicitly allowed under institutional policy with additional safeguards.\n\n\n\nVersion History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\nDate\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nv1.0\n2025-12-01\nInitial adaptation of McCausland & Crotty GP qPCR assay.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nMcCausland MM, Crotty S.
