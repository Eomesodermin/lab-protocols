# Welcome

This site hosts the standardised protocol library for the lab, including buffers, mouse and human workflows, flow panels, and general methods. All documents follow a common Quarto template and are versioned.

Use the navigation bar on the left to browse by category or search for a protocol by name.

## How to use this library

- **Browse by category** using the sidebar:
  - *Buffers* – all stock and working solutions.
  - *Mouse* – mouse tissue processing and functional assays.
  - *Human* – human PBMC and cell line protocols.
  - *General* – cross-cutting methods (e.g. flow staining, nucleofection).

- **Download as PDF**  
  Each protocol page includes a PDF version suitable for printing or attaching to experiment documentation.

- **Search**  
  Use the search box in the sidebar to find protocols by keyword (e.g. “liver digestion”, “PBMC”, “ACK lysis”).

## Naming and versioning conventions

Protocols and buffers follow a consistent naming scheme:

- **Buffers:** `buf_<target>_vX.Y`, e.g. `buf_liver_digestion_v1.0`
- **Mouse protocols:** `prot_mus_<tissue_or_process>_vX.Y`
- **Human protocols:** `prot_hum_<tissue_or_process>_vX.Y`
- **General protocols:** `prot_gen_<process>_vX.Y`

Version numbers are incremented when the procedure changes in a way that could affect results (reagent changes, timings, etc.).

The **title** and **version** in each protocol’s YAML header define what appears on the website and in the PDF.

## Document structure

Most protocols follow a common structure:

1. **Purpose and scope** – what the protocol is for and when to use it.  
2. **Reagents and materials** – linked to buffer entries where applicable.  
3. **Equipment** – key instruments and settings.  
4. **Procedure** – stepwise instructions.  
5. **Notes and troubleshooting** – optional recommendations, pitfalls, or variants.

Buffers have a simplified structure focusing on:

- Composition (final concentrations)
- Preparation steps
- Storage and stability
- Safety considerations
