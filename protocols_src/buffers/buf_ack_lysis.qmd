# Purpose

ACK lysis buffer is used to selectively lyse erythrocytes in single-cell suspensions derived from mouse or human tissues (e.g. liver digests, spleen, PBMC preparations). Under brief incubation, the buffer efficiently removes red blood cells while preserving leukocyte viability and integrity.

| Ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)    |  X mM             | Primary erythrocyte-lysing component                     |

## Preparation of **1 L ACK lysis buffer**

1. Use a clean **1 L glass bottle** or beaker.
2. Add the following dry reagents:
   - **8.26 g NH₄Cl**
   - **1.00 g KHCO₃**
   - **0.037 g (37 mg) EDTA**
3. Add **1 L sterile distilled (bidest) water**.
4. Mix thoroughly by stirring or gentle swirling until all components are fully dissolved.
5. Measure pH and **adjust to pH 7.2** using dilute HCl.
6. **Sterile-filter** the solution using a **0.22 µm vacuum filter unit**.
7. Aliquot if desired under sterile conditions.

# Labelling

Clearly label each bottle or aliquot with:
- Buffer name: **ACK Lysis Buffer**
- Date of preparation
- Preparer initials
- **Sterile**
- **pH adjusted to 7.2**

# Storage and stability

- Store at **4 °C**.
- Stable for up to **3 months** when sterile.
- **Do not freeze**, as freezing may alter buffer performance.

# Safety and handling

- Wear gloves and eye protection; ammonium chloride is an irritant.
- Dispose of unused buffer and erythrocyte-containing waste according to biological/chemical waste regulations.
- For use in primary tissue processing, preparation and sterile filtration should be performed using appropriate aseptic technique.
