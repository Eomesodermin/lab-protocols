# Purpose

ACK lysis buffer is used to selectively lyse erythrocytes in single-cell suspensions derived from mouse or human tissues (e.g. liver digests, spleen, PBMC preparations). The reagent maintains leukocyte integrity while efficiently removing red blood cells during brief room-temperature incubation.

|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)   | 150 mM               | Primary erythrocyte-lysing component       |
| Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO₃)| 10 mM               | Buffering capacity                          |
| Disodium EDTA (Na₂EDTA)     | 0.1 mM               | Chelates divalent cations; prevents clumping |
| Sterile distilled water     | —                    | Solvent                                    |

::: callout-note
This composition matches the standard formulation used in immunology workflows (commonly referred to as “ACK lysis buffer” or “RBC lysis buffer”).

## Preparation of **1 L ACK lysis buffer**

1. Add the following to a 1 L glass bottle or beaker:
   - **8.02 g NH₄Cl** (150 mM)  
   - **1.00 g KHCO₃** (10 mM)  
   - **0.037 g Na₂EDTA** (0.1 mM)
2. Add ~800 mL sterile distilled water.
3. Stir or gently swirl until fully dissolved.
4. Adjust the final volume to **1 L** with sterile distilled water.
5. Filter-sterilize using a **0.22 µm PES or PVDF filter**.
6. Aliquot if desired.

### pH adjustment  
- Typically **no pH adjustment is required**; the solution should be at pH ~7.2–7.4.  
- If necessary, adjust minimally with sterile HCl or NaOH.

# Storage and stability

- Store at **4 °C** for up to **3 months**.  
- Aliquots stored sterilely remain stable for common immunology workflows.  
- **Do not freeze**; precipitation and performance changes may occur.

| Ammonium chloride            | Various  | —      | Analytical or cell-culture grade       |
| Potassium bicarbonate        | Various  | —      | Store tightly sealed                   |
| Disodium EDTA (Na₂EDTA)      | Various  | —      | Chelates divalent cations              |
| Sterile distilled water      | —        | —      | Solvent                                |

# Safety

- Wear gloves and eye protection; NH₄Cl is an irritant.  
- Dispose of unused buffer and erythrocyte-containing waste as biological/chemical waste.  
- Prepare and filter-sterilize the buffer in a biosafety cabinet when used for primary tissue processing.
