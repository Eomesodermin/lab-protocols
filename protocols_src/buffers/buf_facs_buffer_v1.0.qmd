# Purpose

This buffer is used for washing and resuspending cells during flow cytometry staining, FACS sorting, and MACS-based enrichment. It helps maintain cell viability, prevents clumping, and minimises nonspecific binding.

# Linked protocols

This buffer is used in:

- **Mouse Liver Dissociation to Single-Cell Suspension** – `LIV-001` (v1.0)  
- Additional protocols as needed.

# Composition (1× FACS/MACS Buffer)

Typical preparation for **500 mL** of buffer:

| Component  | Stock concentration | Volume for 500 mL | Final concentration | Notes            |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| PBS 1×    | —                   | 500 mL            | —                   | Base buffer      |
| FCS       | —                   | 10 mL             | 2% (v/v)            | Heat-inactivated, if used |
| EDTA      | 0.5 M               | 2 mL              | 2 mM                | Sterile stock    |

(Volumes above reflect the original SOP recipe: PBS 1× 500 mL, FCS 10 mL, EDTA (0.5 M) 2 mL.)

# Preparation

1. Start with **500 mL PBS 1×** in a sterile bottle.
2. Add **10 mL FCS** (to achieve 2% v/v final).
3. Add **2 mL EDTA 0.5 M stock** (to achieve 2 mM final).
4. Mix gently by inversion.
5. If sterility is required, filter the buffer through a **0.22 µm filter** into a sterile storage bottle.
6. Label with:
   - “FACS/MACS Buffer (PBS + 2% FCS + 2 mM EDTA)”

   - Version (`BUF-FACS-v1.0`)

::: {.callout-tip}
For highly sensitive applications (e.g. scRNA-seq, FACS of rare populations), prepare fresh or use small aliquots to minimise repeated warming/cooling cycles and contamination risk.

# Storage and stability

- Store at **4 °C**, protected from light if possible.
- Recommended to use within **4–6 weeks**, or according to internal lab validation and microbial QC.
- Before use, invert gently to resuspend any settled components.
- Avoid repeated temperature cycling; if frequent bench use is expected, consider preparing smaller working aliquots.

# Reagent details

| Component  | Supplier | Cat# | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|
| PBS 1×    | [TBD]    | [TBD]| Sterile, Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺-free recommended |
| FCS       | [TBD]    | [TBD]| Heat-inactivated if required by downstream applications |
| EDTA 0.5 M| [TBD]    | [TBD]| Sterile stock solution; pH ~8.0     |

# Safety (brief)

- Handle biological samples in FACS buffer according to institutional biosafety rules.
- FCS is of animal origin; treat as a potential biohazard.
- EDTA is of low toxicity at working concentrations but should be handled with standard lab PPE.
