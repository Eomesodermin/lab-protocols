# Purpose

This buffer is a **2× concentrated freezing medium** used for the cryopreservation of PBMCs and other lymphocytes. When mixed 1:1 with a cell suspension in R10 or R0, it yields a standard **final freezing medium containing 10% DMSO and 5% FCS** (or 10% FCS if starting from R10), suitable for controlled-rate freezing.

# Working buffer composition

| Component           | Final concentration (2×) | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| RPMI 1640 (R0)     | —                         | Base medium                                 |
| Fetal calf serum   | 10% (v/v)                 | Protects cells during freezing              |
| DMSO (cell-grade)  | 20% (v/v)                 | Cryoprotectant                               |

When mixed 1:1 with cells in R10 or R0, the **final freezing medium** contains:

- **10% DMSO**  
- **5–10% FCS** (depending on suspension medium)  
- RPMI base medium

## Stock reagents

| Reagent           | Stock concentration | Notes                           |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| RPMI 1640         | —                   | Sterile-filtered                |
| DMSO, cell-grade  | 100%                | Use fresh or freshly opened     |
| Fetal calf serum  | —                   | Heat-inactivated recommended    |

## Preparation of **10 mL 2× freezing medium**

1. In a sterile 15 mL tube, add:
   - **7 mL R0 medium** (RPMI without serum)  
   - **1 mL heat-inactivated FCS** (10% v/v)  
   - **2 mL DMSO** (20% v/v)
2. Mix gently by inversion; **do not vortex**.
3. Keep on ice until use.

::: callout-warning
DMSO is toxic at room temperature. Keep the 2× freezing medium on **ice**, and **mix with cells immediately** after preparation.
:::

# Usage

1. Adjust PBMCs or lymphocytes to **20 × 10⁶ cells/mL** in R10 or R0.  
2. Add an **equal volume** of this 2× freezing medium.  
3. Mix gently by pipetting.  
4. Dispense **1 mL per cryovial** (final 10% DMSO).  
5. Freeze using a **controlled-rate freezing container** (e.g. Mr Frosty) at −70/−80 °C.  
6. Transfer to liquid nitrogen after ≥12 hours.

# Storage and stability

- Use **fresh on the day of preparation**.  
- Keep on **ice** during use.  
- Do **not store** after the experiment; discard any remaining buffer.  
- DMSO-containing mixtures degrade rapidly and should never be refrozen.

|----------------------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| RPMI 1640            | Various   | —      | Base medium                            |
| Fetal calf serum     | Various   | —      | Heat-inactivated                       |
| DMSO, cell-grade     | Sigma/etc.| —      | Highly hygroscopic; handle aseptically |

# Safety

- Handle DMSO with gloves; it enhances dermal absorption of other chemicals.  
- Prepare freezing medium in a biosafety cabinet using aseptic technique.  
- Dispose of DMSO-containing waste according to institutional chemical waste protocols.  
- Avoid eye/skin contact and inhalation.
