# Purpose

This buffer is used for enzymatic digestion of mouse liver tissue prior to preparation of single-cell suspensions. It supports efficient dissociation while aiming to preserve cell viability for downstream flow cytometry, FACS sorting, and single-cell omics workflows.

# Linked protocols

This buffer is used in:

- **Mouse Liver Dissociation to Single-Cell Suspension** – `LIV-001` (v1.0)

# Composition (final working buffer)

Final working-buffer composition per **5 mL**:

| Component          | Stock concentration | Volume for 5 mL | Final concentration (approx.) | Notes                                |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| DMEM (incomplete) | —                   | to 5 mL         | N/A                           | Base medium                          |
| Collagenase D     | 100 mg/mL           | 10 µL           | 1 mg/mL                       | From frozen stock                    |
| DNase I           | 10 mg/mL            | 1 µL            | 10 µg/mL                      | Added on day of use                  |

::: {.callout-note}
The table above describes the **final working buffer** used in the protocol. In practice, a **stock digestion buffer without DNase** is prepared and frozen in aliquots, and DNase is added only on the day of use (see Preparation and Storage sections).
:::

# Preparation

## A. Prepare “Liver Digestion Stock (no DNase)”

This stock is DMEM + Collagenase D, **without DNase**. It is frozen in aliquots for convenient use.

1. Thaw **Collagenase D** stock (100 mg/mL) on ice or at 4 °C.
2. In a sterile tube, prepare the digestion stock for the desired number of aliquots, for example:

   - For each **5 mL** stock aliquot:
     - Add **~4 mL** DMEM (incomplete).
     - Add **10 µL** Collagenase D stock (100 mg/mL).
     - Mix gently by inversion (avoid foaming).
     - Bring volume to **5 mL** with DMEM (incomplete).

3. Aliquot the digestion stock into sterile tubes (e.g. **3–5 mL per aliquot**, depending on typical experimental usage).
4. Label aliquots clearly with:
   - “Liver Digestion Stock (no DNase)”
   - Concentration
   - Date
   - Version (`BUF-LIV-DIG-v1.0`)
5. Freeze aliquots at **−20 °C**.

## B. Prepare final working Liver Digestion Buffer (day of use)

1. Remove the required number of **Liver Digestion Stock (no DNase)** aliquots from −20 °C and **thaw** at room temperature or 4 °C.
2. For each **5 mL** of final working buffer needed:
   1. Ensure the thawed stock is well mixed (gentle inversion).
   2. Add **1 µL** of DNase I stock (10 mg/mL) to **5 mL** digestion stock.
   3. Mix gently by inversion.
3. Pre-warm the final working buffer to **37 °C** before use (e.g. by placing tubes in a 37 °C water bath or incubator).
4. If desired, pre-aliquot **3 mL** of the final working buffer into pre-labeled 50 mL liver collection tubes, and retain additional buffer in a separate tube for perfusion.

::: {.callout-tip}
To minimise variability, prepare all working-buffer aliquots for a given experiment at the **same time** using the **same DNase stock** and keep them at 37 °C only for as long as required during the digestion step.

# Storage and stability

## Liver Digestion Stock (no DNase)

- **Composition**: DMEM (incomplete) + Collagenase D at 1 mg/mL final (when diluted as described).
- **Storage**:
  - Store aliquots at **−20 °C**.
  - Avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles (use single-use aliquots where possible).
- **Stability**:
  - Recommended to use within **3–6 months** of preparation, or according to internal lab validation.
- Before use:
  - Thaw at room temperature or 4 °C.
  - Mix gently to ensure homogeneity.

## Final working Liver Digestion Buffer (with DNase)

- Prepared from thawed **Liver Digestion Stock (no DNase)** + DNase I.
- **Use on the same day** as preparation.
- Keep at **37 °C** only during active digestion steps; otherwise, keep at room temperature for short periods.
- Do not refreeze working buffer once DNase has been added; discard any unused working buffer at the end of the day.

## Stock reagents

- **Collagenase D stock (100 mg/mL)**  
  - Store as recommended by the manufacturer (typically **−20 °C** in aliquots).  
  - Avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles.

- **DNase I stock (10 mg/mL)**  
  - Store according to manufacturer’s instructions (often **−20 °C**).  
  - Avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles.

- **DMEM (incomplete)**  
  - Store at **4 °C**, protected from light.  
  - Respect manufacturer’s expiry date.

::: {.callout-note}
If the lab validates alternative storage conditions (e.g. short-term storage of working buffer at 4 °C), document the conditions and update the version number and description accordingly.

# Safety (brief)

- Handle mouse tissues and enzymatic digestion buffers in accordance with institutional biosafety rules (S1/S2 as applicable).
- Collagenase and DNase are enzymes; avoid inhalation of powders and minimise contact with eyes or damaged skin.
- Dispose of buffer waste and contaminated consumables in appropriate **biohazard** or **chemical** waste streams, as determined by local regulations.
