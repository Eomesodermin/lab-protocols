# Purpose

This medium is used for in vitro culture and proliferation assays of murine NK cells. It is based on complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with nutrients essential for lymphocyte viability and proliferation. **IL-15 is added fresh immediately before plating cells** and is not included in the stock medium.

## Preparation of **500 mL NK medium (cRPMI base)**

1. In a sterile bottle, combine:
   - **450 mL** RPMI 1640  
   - **50 mL** FCS (10% final)  
2. Add supplements:
   - **5 mL** Pen/Strep (100× stock → 1% final)  
   - **5 mL** HEPES (1 M stock → 10 mM final)  
   - **5 mL** Sodium pyruvate (100 mM stock → 1 mM final)  
   - **5 mL** NEAA (100× stock → 1% final)  
3. Add β-mercaptoethanol:  
   - Final concentration: **50 μM**  
   - If using 50 mM stock: add **0.5 mL**  
   - If using 14.3 M stock: prepare a working dilution before adding  
4. Mix gently by inversion; do **not vortex**.  
5. Label with:
   - “NK medium (cRPMI base)”  
   - Date of preparation  
   - Expiry (4–5 weeks at 4 °C)

::: callout-warning
β-mercaptoethanol is hazardous. Handle it in a fume hood and avoid skin contact. Do not open concentrated β-ME bottles inside a biosafety cabinet.

# Safety

- Handle β-mercaptoethanol and all supplements using gloves and eye protection.  
- β-ME requires fume hood handling due to volatility.  
- Prepare medium under aseptic conditions inside a biosafety cabinet.  
- Dispose of expired or contaminated medium as biohazardous waste.
