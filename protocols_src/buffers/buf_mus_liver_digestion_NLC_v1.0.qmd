# Purpose

This buffer is used for enzymatic digestion of mouse liver tissue to generate viable single-cell suspensions. It contains Collagenase IV and DNase I at working concentrations suitable for dissociating liver parenchyma while preserving lymphocyte viability.

# Working buffer composition

| Component          | Final concentration | Notes                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Collagenase IV     | 0.5 mg/mL (example) | Adjust per validated stock; see below   |
| DNase I            | 25–50 µg/mL         | Reduces clumping; protects viability    |
| PBS (1×), sterile  | —                   | Solvent                                 |

::: callout-note
The final working concentrations here follow the proportions described in the original SOP (100 µL Collagenase IV into 10 mL PBS + 50 µL DNase I). Adjust exact activity units according to vendor.

# Preparation

## Stock solutions

| Reagent        | Typical stock concentration | Storage              |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Collagenase IV | 100 mg/mL in PBS or HBSS    | Aliquoted at −20 °C  |
| DNase I        | 10 mg/mL in buffer (manufacturer) | Aliquoted at −20 °C |

## Preparation of **10 mL working buffer (2×)**

1. Thaw aliquots of Collagenase IV and DNase I on ice.  
2. In a sterile tube, add:  
   - **100 µL** Collagenase IV stock  
   - **50 µL** DNase I stock  
3. Add **PBS up to 10 mL total volume**.  
4. Mix gently by inversion; **do not vortex**.

This 2× buffer is diluted 1:1 with PBS at the time of digestion (2 mL 2× buffer + 2 mL PBS per liver sample).

# Storage and stability

- Store freshly prepared digestion buffer **on ice** during use.  
- Do **not** freeze after mixing with enzymes.  
- Discard after same-day use.  
- Collagenase IV and DNase I **stock solutions**:  
  - Store at **−20 °C, aliquoted**, avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles.

| DNase I        | Various       | —      | Prevents clumping            |
| PBS, sterile   | Various       | —      | Solvent                      |

# Safety

- Handle enzymes with gloves and eye protection to avoid skin or mucosal irritation.  
- Dispose of enzyme-containing waste as biological/chemical waste according to institutional guidelines.  
- Use sterile technique inside a biosafety cabinet.
