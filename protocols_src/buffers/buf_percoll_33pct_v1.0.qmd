# Purpose

This buffer is used as a 33% Percoll solution for density-based enrichment of leukocytes from digested liver. It separates hepatocytes (floating) from leukocyte- and erythrocyte-enriched pellets during centrifugation.

# Linked protocols

This buffer is used in:

- **Mouse Liver Dissociation to Single-Cell Suspension** – `LIV-001` (v1.0)

# Composition (per 10 mL 33% Percoll)

Based on the original SOP:

| Component            | Stock                | Volume for 10 mL | Approx. final composition | Notes         |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Percoll (sterile)    | 100%                 | 3.33 mL          | 33% (v/v)                 | Undiluted stock |
| PBS 1×               | —                    | 6.29 mL          | —                         | Isotonic medium |
| PBS 10×              | 10×                  | 370.37 µL        | Adjusts osmolarity        | Added last    |

# Preparation

1. Equilibrate **Percoll stock** to **room temperature** before preparation.
2. For each **10 mL** of 33% Percoll:
   1. In a sterile 15 mL or 50 mL tube, add **3.33 mL** Percoll (sterile).
   2. Add **6.29 mL** PBS 1×.
   3. Add **370.37 µL** PBS 10×.
   4. Mix gently by inversion until homogeneous.
3. If preparing multiple aliquots (e.g. **10 mL per liver**), scale volumes accordingly.
4. Aliquot **10 mL** per labeled 15 mL tube for each liver sample.
5. Label tubes with:
   - “33% Percoll”
   - Date of preparation
   - Version (`BUF-PERC-33-v1.0`)

::: {.callout-note}
Maintain sterility by preparing the solution in a biosafety cabinet or sterile environment if it will contact viable cells used for culture or sensitive downstream applications.

# Storage and stability

- **Working 33% Percoll solution** is generally prepared **fresh on the day of use**.
- Short-term storage (same day) at **room temperature** is acceptable.
- Do not freeze 33% Percoll; discard any unused working solution at the end of the day.
- Stock Percoll (100%) should be stored according to manufacturer’s instructions (typically at room temperature), protected from contamination.

# Safety (brief)

- Percoll solutions should be handled with gloves and standard lab PPE.
- Dispose of Percoll-containing waste according to local chemical and biohazard regulations when mixed with biological material.
- Avoid ingestion and contact with eyes; consult the manufacturer’s safety data sheet (SDS) for details.
