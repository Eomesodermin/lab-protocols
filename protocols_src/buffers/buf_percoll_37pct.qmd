**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This buffer is used as a **37% Percoll solution** for density-based enrichment of leukocytes from digested liver tissue. During centrifugation, hepatocytes and debris remain in the supernatant, while leukocyte-enriched pellets form at the bottom of the tube.

### Density vs osmolality (important conceptual note)

Percoll provides **density**, not physiological salt content.  
On its own, Percoll is **hypotonic** and unsuitable for live cells.

- **Density** determines where cells separate during centrifugation.
- **Osmolality** determines whether cells survive the procedure.

To maintain **physiological (1× PBS) osmolality**, Percoll must be rendered **isotonic** by adding concentrated salts (10× PBS).  
Once Percoll stock has been adjusted to isotonic conditions, **all subsequent working solutions can be prepared by dilution with 1× PBS only**.

# Preparation of isotonic Percoll stock (required once per bottle)

Percoll stock **must be rendered isotonic before use**. This step is performed **once per bottle** and must be done under **sterile conditions**.

## Preparation from a 1000 mL Percoll bottle

1. Under a **biosafety cabinet**, using sterile technique:
   - Remove **100 mL Percoll** from the original 1000 mL bottle.
   - Transfer this 100 mL into a **clean, sterile glass bottle** (retain for later use).
2. To the original Percoll bottle, add **100 mL sterile 10× PBS**.
3. Cap securely and mix thoroughly by gentle inversion.
4. Clearly label the bottle with:
   - **“Isotonic Percoll”**
   - **“+100 mL 10× PBS”**
   - Date of preparation
   - Name or initials
   - **“Sterile”**

The remaining volume (~1000 mL) is now **isotonic Percoll stock**.

## Making the reserved 100 mL Percoll aliquot isotonic

1. To the previously removed **100 mL Percoll aliquot**, add:
   - **11.11 mL sterile 10× PBS**
2. Mix gently by inversion until homogeneous.
3. Label clearly with:
   - **“Isotonic Percoll”**
   - **“+11.11 mL 10× PBS”**
   - Date
   - Name or initials
   - **“Sterile”**

This aliquot is now **functionally identical** to the main isotonic Percoll stock and can be used interchangeably.

:::callout-warning
Percoll stock and all derived solutions **must be kept sterile**.

# Important note on isotonic Percoll usage

All working Percoll solutions in this protocol assume that **input Percoll is already isotonic**.

Therefore:
- **Do not add 10× PBS** when preparing 37% Percoll working solutions.
- Only **dilution with sterile 1× PBS** is required.

# Composition (per 10 mL 37% Percoll)

| Component | Stock | Volume for 10 mL | Final composition | Notes |
|------------------|-------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Percoll (isotonic) | 100% | **3.70 mL** | 37% (v/v) | Pre-adjusted stock |
| PBS 1× | — | **6.30 mL** | — | Diluent |

---

# Preparation of 37% Percoll working solution

1. Equilibrate **isotonic Percoll stock** to **room temperature**.
2. In a sterile 15 mL or 50 mL tube, add:
   - **3.70 mL isotonic Percoll**
   - **6.30 mL sterile PBS 1×**
3. Mix gently by inversion until homogeneous.
4. Prepare sufficient volume for the experiment (typically **10 mL per liver**).
5. Aliquot immediately into labelled **15 mL conical tubes**.

:::callout-note
Prepare 37% Percoll fresh on the day of use for optimal separation performance and cell viability.

# Storage and stability

- **37% Percoll working solution**: prepare fresh on the day of use.
- Same-day storage at **room temperature** is acceptable.
- Do not freeze working solutions.
- **Isotonic Percoll stock** should be stored according to manufacturer’s instructions and maintained under sterile conditions.

# How isotonic Percoll calculations work (reference)

This section explains why **10× PBS** is added to Percoll and how the required volume is calculated.

## Definitions

- **V_T** = total final volume  
- **V_P** = volume of Percoll (contains no salts)  
- **V_10x** = volume of 10× PBS  

The remaining volume is **1× PBS**.

## Salt balance logic

The final solution must contain the same total amount of salt as **V_T mL of 1× PBS**.

Salt contributions:
- Percoll contributes **0×**
- 1× PBS contributes **1×**
- 10× PBS contributes **10×**

### Step 1: Express total salt content

```math
(V_T - V_P - V_10x) + 10 · V_10x = V_T
```

### Step 2: Combine terms

```math
V_T - V_P + 9 · V_10x = V_T
```

### Step 3: Subtract V_T from both sides

```math
- V_P + 9 · V_10x = 0
```

### Step 4: Rearrange

```math
9 · V_10x = V_P
```

### Final rule

```math
V_10x = V_P / 9
```

**In words:**  
For every **9 mL of Percoll**, add **1 mL of 10× PBS** to make the solution isotonic.
