# Purpose

This buffer is used to lyse red blood cells in single-cell suspensions derived from liver (and other tissues, if applicable) while aiming to preserve leukocyte populations for downstream analysis.

\tableofcontents

# Linked protocols

This buffer is used in:

- **Mouse Liver Dissociation to Single-Cell Suspension** – `LIV-001` (v1.0)  
- Additional protocols where RBC lysis is required.

# Composition

This protocol assumes the use of a **commercially supplied RBC lysis buffer**, such as:

- **HybriMax RBC lysis buffer** (Sigma), used at 1× working strength.

If an alternative supplier is used (e.g. BioLegend RBC Lysis Buffer), document the product and use according to manufacturer instructions, adapting incubation times as internally validated.

# Preparation

## A. From HybriMax (ready-to-use formulation)

1. Confirm whether the commercial HybriMax RBC lysis buffer is supplied as **ready-to-use (1×)** or **concentrate (e.g. 10×)**.
2. If supplied as **1× solution**:
   - Aliquot into smaller working volumes (e.g. 5–10 mL) to avoid repeated bottle opening.
   - No further dilution is required.
3. If supplied as **concentrate (e.g. 10×)**:
   - Dilute with sterile water or buffer as per manufacturer’s instructions to make **1× RBC lysis solution**.
   - Mix thoroughly.
4. Label aliquots with:
   - “RBC Lysis Buffer (HybriMax)”
   - 1× or stock concentration
   - Date of preparation
   - Version (`BUF-RBC-HYB-v1.0`)

::: {.callout-note}
The liver protocol `LIV-001` uses **0.5 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer per sample** after Percoll enrichment, with a **7-minute** incubation at room temperature.

# Storage and stability

- Store the commercial RBC lysis buffer according to manufacturer’s instructions (commonly at **2–8 °C**).
- Keep tightly closed to avoid evaporation and contamination.
- Aliquoted 1× working solution should also be stored at **2–8 °C** and used within the period recommended by the manufacturer or internal validation.
- Do not freeze unless explicitly supported by the manufacturer.

(If using a different brand, add a row or update Supplier/Cat# accordingly.)

# Safety (brief)

- RBC lysis buffers typically contain detergents and may contain **sodium azide** or other toxic components.
- Handle with gloves and standard lab PPE.
- Avoid contact with eyes and skin; consult the manufacturer’s safety data sheet (SDS).
- Dispose of RBC-lysis waste and contaminated consumables in accordance with local chemical and biohazard regulations.
