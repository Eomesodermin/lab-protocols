# Purpose

This medium is used for routine propagation of Vero cells for LCMV focus-forming assays and other virological applications.

# Components (Final volume: 500 mL)

| Component                                                                 | Amount    | Final concentration / note          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| DMEM (high glucose, with L-glutamine, phenol red)                        | to 500 mL | Base medium                         |
| Heat-inactivated FCS/FBS                                                 | 50 mL     | 10% (v/v)                           |
| Penicillin–Streptomycin (100×; 10,000 U/mL penicillin, 10,000 µg/mL strep) | 5 mL      | 1× final                            |
| 2-mercaptoethanol (100× stock; see lab stock sheet for concentration)    | 0.5 mL    | 1× final (typical 50–100 µM range)  |

:::callout-warning
For Vero cell culture, always use **DMEM-based medium**. Do **not** confuse this with RPMI-based media used elsewhere in the plaque/FFA protocol (e.g. for sample dilution).

# Preparation

1. In a sterile biosafety cabinet, add ~400 mL of DMEM to a sterile 500 mL bottle.  
2. Add:
   - 50 mL heat-inactivated FCS/FBS.  
   - 5 mL Penicillin–Streptomycin (100× stock) to achieve 1× final.  
   - 0.5 mL of the 100× 2-mercaptoethanol stock (check your lab stock sheet for the exact stock concentration and resulting final µM).  
3. Top up with DMEM to a final volume of **500 mL**.  
4. Mix gently by inversion.  
5. If any component was added from a non-sterile container, sterile-filter the complete medium (0.22 µm filter) into a fresh sterile bottle.  
6. Label with:
   - “Vero propagation medium (DMEM + 10% FCS + 1× P/S + 2-ME)”  
   - Date of preparation  
   - Initials  

7. Store at **4°C** for up to **4 weeks**, protected from light.

# Use

- Warm medium to **37°C** before use with cells.  
- Discard medium if there is any sign of contamination (turbidity, threads, pH shift) or if it is past the defined expiry (4 weeks from preparation).
