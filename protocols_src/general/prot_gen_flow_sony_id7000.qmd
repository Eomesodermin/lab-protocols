   - If using a shared lab account containing saved controls, log into that account (as applicable).
8. Confirm the ID7000 connects to the computer (bottom right of software). Wait a couple of minutes.
9. The **Priming Wizard** should open automatically. Click **Start**.
10. While priming runs, prepare QC beads in FACS tubes:
    - **AlignCheck beads:** 450 µL FACS Flow + 2 drops beads
    - **Sony 8-peak beads:** 350 µL FACS Flow + 1 drop beads
11. When priming is complete, close the QC window if it pops up.
12. Click **Start Daily and Performance QC**.
13. Open the instrument door.
14. Remove **Clean** and **Rinse** tubes from the tube station.
15. Place **AlignCheck** and **8-peak** bead tubes into the tube station in the order shown in the QC window.
16. Close the door and follow prompts to run QC.

::: callout-tip
## If QC fails due to pressure
A pressure-related error can cause QC failure. Re-check **Waste** and **Sheath** tank levels and correct if needed, then re-run QC.
:::

## B. Experiment setup

1. After QC passes, go to **Experiment** tab.
2. Click **Experiment designer**.

   - 488 nm
   - 561 nm
   - 637 nm
4. Add fluorochromes (e.g., FITC, APC, PE) by typing and clicking **Add**.

::: callout-note
## Order of fluorochromes
- If acquiring single stains in **tubes**, fluorochrome add-order does not matter.
- If acquiring single stains in a **plate**, match fluorochrome order to the plate layout.
- If using previously saved single-stain controls from the library and no new controls are needed, you may skip Section C.
:::

5. Fill in metadata (Marker, Species, Clone, Lot number, etc.).
6. Click **Next** until **Instrument Settings** step.

11. Under **Acquisition** tab, click **Layout Editor** (Plate section).
12. Hold **Ctrl** and select the unassigned positions corresponding to the number of samples.
13. Set **Sample Group** to `Sample Group - 1`.
14. Optionally check **Auto acquisition target**.
15. Name each sample position under **Sample Information**.
16. Close Layout Editor.

## C. Acquire single stains and perform unmixing

### C1. Load single stains

1. If using tubes:
   - Retrieve the **24-position 5 mL tube rack** from FCCF fridge.
   - The **notch** marks **A1**.
2. Arrange single-stain tubes (or plate) in the order shown in the software layout.

::: callout-note
## ArC beads for fixable viability dyes
If using ArC beads stained with a fixable amine-reactive viability dye, also add **unstained ArC beads** as a separate tube.
In the software:
- Acquisition -> Layout Editor -> select tube position
- Name it (e.g., "Unstained ArC beads")
- Under Sample Settings:
  - Sample Group: **Single Positive Controls**
  - Check **Auto acquisition target**
:::

3. Open door, orient rack/plate with **A1 notch** at bottom left, place on AutoSampler.
4. Close door and click **Load**.
   - If “Cooling sample stage is in progress” appears, click **Yes**.

### C2. Instrument settings for single stains (example values)

1. Open **Instrument Settings**.
2. Under **Detector and Threshold**:
   - FSC Gain = **17** (example for fixed/permeabilized PBMCs)
   - SSC Voltage (%) = **37.5** (example for fixed/permeabilized PBMCs)
3. Under **Flow Control**:
   - Sample Flow Rate = **3.0**

::: callout-note
## Adjust for your sample type
The FSC/SSC and flow rate values above are examples given for fixed/permeabilized PBMCs. Adjust for other cell types and staining conditions.
:::

### C3. Stopping condition for single stains

1. Open **Stopping Condition**.
2. Set **Total Events = 5,000** (single stains).
3. Click **Sync stopping conditions** to apply to all.

### C4. Preview and gate setup

1. Preview each single stain using **Preview**.
2. Adjust gates (“A” and “Positive”) as needed.

::: callout-tip
## Gate and scale consistency
- Apply the same “A” gate to all single stains using **Sync Scale and Gate**.
- The “Positive” gate should be tight and placed on the highest-intensity events.
:::

::: callout-warning
## Off-scale events and voltage changes
If a conjugate is off-scale, reducing PMT voltage can be used to complete acquisition, but the preferred long-term fix is to **reduce antibody concentration** in future experiments.
:::

3. Click **Stop** to move to the next sample.
   - If it does not advance: right-click tube position -> **Set Current Position**.

### C5. Record single stains

1. Right-click the first tube (usually “Unstained”) -> **Set Current Position**.
2. Acquire single stains:
   - Manual: **Acquire**
   - Automated: **Auto Acquire** (requires Auto acquisition targets)

### C6. Unmixing

1. Go to **Unmixing** tab.
2. Click **Unmixing Settings**.
3. If you added an unstained ArC bead control as the negative gate for the live/dead single stain, confirm the negative reference is correctly assigned.
4. Click **Calculate**.

::: callout-note
## Saturation warnings during unmixing
If prompted that saturation of x% is observed:
- Small % (e.g., <0.1%): Continue
- Large %: the single stain is too bright
  - Re-run single stain with reduced voltage (Instrument Settings -> Detector & Threshold -> PMT Voltage (%) -> Synchronous Voltage Adjustment)
  - Preferably: plan to reduce antibody concentration in future experiments
:::

5. When prompted to apply spectral references to other sample groups with the same laser settings, click **Apply**.
6. Confirm the **Unmixing** toggle (top right) is **ON** (blue).

# Troubleshooting

- **QC fails due to pressure:** re-check waste/sheath levels and re-run QC.
- **Single stain saturation during unmixing:** re-run with reduced PMT voltage short-term; reduce antibody concentration long-term.
- **Software does not advance tube position:** right-click the tube position -> **Set Current Position**.
