**Protocol ID:** {{< meta protocol_id >}}  
**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino  
**Adapted from:** FCCF SOP – Data handling on Sony ID7000 systems fileciteturn1file0  

# Purpose

This protocol defines mandatory rules and best practices for **data export, organization, storage, sharing, and deletion** for experiments performed on the **Sony Spectral Cell Analyzer ID7000**.

The aim is to:
- Prevent data loss
- Avoid unnecessary duplication of experiments and unmixing matrices
- Ensure compliance with FCCF data-retention policies
- Reduce congestion on instrument and analysis workstations

# Scope

This SOP applies to:
- All users of the **Sony ID7000**
- All **instrument PCs** and **external analysis workstations I and II**
- All data types generated by the ID7000 software, including:
  - FCS files
  - Experiment files (`.exdat`)
  - Spectral reference controls

# Core rules (read before use)

::: callout-warning
## Mandatory rules
Failure to follow these rules may result in **permanent data loss** without notice.
:::

- **Export FCS files and experiments immediately after each measurement**
- **Only store data inside your personal `USER` folder**
- **All data outside the `USER` folder will always be deleted**
- FCCF performs **bi-weekly deletion** of:
  - All experiments and library controls in the ID7000 software
  - Exported experiments and FCS files in `USER` folders older than **6 months**
- Users are responsible for **early deletion of data no longer needed**

# Data types and definitions

| Data type | File extension | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FCS files | `.fcs` | Event-level flow cytometry data |
| Experiment files | `.exdat` | ID7000 experiment definitions, layouts, and settings |
| Reference controls | internal / exported | Spectral reference controls stored in the library or exported |

# Exporting FCS files

## Using ID7000 Data Agent

- FCS file export is handled by the **ID7000 Data Agent**
- The Data Agent starts automatically when FCS export is initiated
- The Data Agent icon appears in the **task tray**

### Monitoring export status

- Hover over the **ID7000 Data Agent** icon to view export progress and status
- A **log file** documenting the export is written to the output folder

### Opening the export folder

1. Right-click the **ID7000 Data Agent** icon
2. Select **Open Latest Output Folder**
3. Review exported files and the associated log file

# Exporting experiment files (.exdat)

1. In the ID7000 software, go to:
   - **File** → **Database**
2. Click **Export**
3. Select the experiment(s) to export
4. Click **Export**

::: callout-warning
## Unmixing matrices
Avoid creating multiple unnecessary unmixing matrices.
Multiple matrices generate **multiple datasets** during FCS export and complicate downstream analysis.
:::

# Folder structure and organization

## Mandatory folder structure

::: callout-tip
## One USER folder per user
Create **one folder named with your username** as a subfolder of `USER` on the desktop and **use only this folder** for all exports.
:::

Recommended structure:

```
USER/
└── <username>/
    ├── fcs/
    ├── experiments/
    ├── reference_controls/
    ├── projects/
    │   ├── project_A/
    │   └── project_B/
```

- You may save the export path in **ID7000 Preferences**
- Use subfolders to separate:
  - FCS files
  - Experiment files
  - Reference controls
  - Project-specific datasets

# Data deletion and cleanup

::: callout-warning
## Data deletion policy
FCCF routinely deletes data without further notice.
:::

You must:
- Delete **old experiments** immediately after analysis on the analysis PC
- Delete **already analyzed FCS files** from all PCs
- Delete unnecessary **reference controls** from the library after export

Additional rules:
- Do **not** make reference controls public (creates duplicates)
- Export reference controls before deletion if they are still needed

# Sharing reference controls

If you want to share reference controls with colleagues:
- Export them to a **dedicated folder**
- Include clear metadata:
  - Associated project
  - Experiment name
  - Date
  - Fluorochrome / antibody information

# Use of external analysis workstations

All rules in this SOP apply equally to:
- External Analysis Workstation I
- External Analysis Workstation II

## Recommended workflow to reduce device usage time

::: callout-note
## Efficiency recommendation
To minimize time at the instrument PCs:
:::

1. Perform **experiment setup** on:
   - External Analysis Workstation I (older, slower)
2. Export the experiment file (`.exdat`)
3. Import the experiment on the instrument PC
4. Perform **unmixing adjustments** on:
   - External Analysis Workstation II (newer, faster)
5. Export/import `.exdat` files as required

# Long-term storage and transfer

- The **recommended storage location** is the **BTC data server**
- Instructions for access:
  - `https://btc-community.uni-bonn.de/your-network/`

::: callout-tip
## Best practice
Transfer data to BTC as soon as possible after export and verify file integrity before deleting local copies.
:::

# Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Missing FCS files | Export not completed | Check Data Agent log and re-export |
| Duplicate datasets | Multiple unmixing matrices | Remove redundant matrices and re-export |
| Data deleted unexpectedly | Stored outside USER folder | Always export into USER/<username>/ |

# Version history

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1.0 | 2025-11-21 | Dillon Corvino | Converted FCCF Sony ID7000 data handling SOP into Abdullah Lab Quarto protocol standard. |
