**Protocol ID:** {{< meta protocol_id >}}  
**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This protocol describes a standard flow cytometry staining workflow for suspension cells, including:

- Optional **tetramer staining**.  
- Surface staining with Fc block and live/dead dye.  
- Optional intracellular staining (e.g. BD Cytofix/Cytoperm-based).  
- Optional intranuclear staining (e.g. eBioscience FOXP3 fix/perm-based).

It is intended as a general framework for murine or human samples and can be adapted to specific panels and antibody combinations.

---

# Buffer nomenclature (important)

- **FACS Buffer** = PBS + FCS  
- **MACS Buffer** = PBS + FCS + EDTA  

Unless otherwise specified, **MACS buffer is used throughout this protocol** to minimise cell clumping during staining and washing.

Tetramer staining is a specific exception (see below).

---

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- Keep cells and antibody mixes cold (on ice or at 4 °C) and protected from light whenever possible.
- Default staining range: **2 × 10⁵ – 1 × 10⁶ cells per well** (96-well format).
- Always include appropriate controls (unstained, live/dead only, FMO, single-colour controls).
- Fixation and permeabilization conditions must be compatible with antibodies and fluorochromes used.
- Commercial fixation/permeabilization kits should be used according to manufacturer instructions.

:::callout-warning
Improper fixation/permeabilization or incompatible buffers can destroy epitopes and fluorochromes, leading to misleading intracellular or intranuclear staining.
:::

:::callout-warning
Antibodies and tetramers are **protein reagents and mechanically sensitive**.  
Do **not vortex**, as this can denature proteins and promote aggregation.  
Instead, mix gently by pipetting or inversion. If needed, briefly spin reagents in a **mini “pulse” centrifuge (quick spin)** to collect liquid and pellet aggregates before use.
:::

:::callout-tip
Surface markers (including live/dead dyes and tetramers) should generally be stained **before fixation/permeabilization** for best performance.

# Approximate timing

- Tetramer staining (optional): 20 min  
- Plate setup and Fc block: 10–15 min  
- Surface staining: 30 min  
- Fixation only (no intracellular): 15–20 min  
- Fix + permeabilization + intracellular/intranuclear staining: 1.5–2 h  
- Optional overnight intranuclear stain: +1 day  

**Total (surface only):** ~1–1.5 h  
**Total (full workflow):** ~3–4 h (or overnight)

# Procedure

## Step 1 – Plate setup and buffers

1. Prepare buffers:
   - **FACS buffer** (PBS + 2% FCS) — *for tetramer staining only*.
   - **MACS buffer** (PBS + 2% FCS + 2 mM EDTA) — *default buffer for all other steps*.
2. Prepare single-cell suspensions.
3. Count cells and adjust concentration to plate **2 × 10⁵ – 1 × 10⁶ cells per well**.
4. Aliquot cells into a 96-well U- or V-bottom plate.
5. Keep plates on ice or at 4 °C.

---

## Step 2 – Tetramer staining (optional, if applicable)

This step applies when staining with MR1 or CD1d tetramers.

1. Prepare a **tetramer staining mix in FACS buffer (no EDTA)**:
   - Fc block: **1:100**
   - Tetramer(s): per manufacturer recommendation
   - Final volume: **50 µL per well**
2. Add **50 µL** tetramer mix to each well.
3. Incubate for **20 min on ice**, protected from light.

:::callout-note
Tetramer staining is performed in **FACS buffer without EDTA** to avoid potential interference with multimer–TCR interactions.  
Whether EDTA exclusion is strictly necessary remains under investigation and will be tested within the lab.
:::

:::callout-note
MR1–5-OP-RU tetramer can be added together with surface antibody staining.  
For CD1d tetramers, compatibility with simultaneous surface staining is currently unclear and will be empirically tested.
:::

4. Without washing, proceed directly to Step 3.

## Step 3 – Surface staining (with live/dead)

**Antibody titration guidance (applies to all surface staining):**
- Surface antibodies: default **1:200** if titration data are unavailable.
- Transcription factors or weakly expressed markers: default **1:50**.

### 3.1 If tetramer staining was performed (from Step 2)

1. Prepare a **2× surface staining master mix in MACS buffer** containing:
   - Live/dead dye (2× final concentration)
   - Surface antibodies (2× final concentration)
2. Add **50 µL** of the 2× surface mix to each well already containing **50 µL tetramer mix**  
   → **Final volume: 100 µL per well (1× final concentration)**.
3. Incubate for **30 min at 4 °C**, protected from light.

### 3.2 If no tetramer staining was performed

1. Prepare a **1× surface staining master mix in MACS buffer** containing:
   - Live/dead dye (1× final concentration)
   - Surface antibodies (1× final concentration)
2. Add **50 µL** of the 1× surface mix directly to each well.
3. Incubate for **30 min at 4 °C**, protected from light.

### 3.3 Wash steps (both cases)

1. Top up each well to **200 µL** with MACS buffer.
2. Centrifuge at **400 g for 2 min**.
3. Flick off the supernatant.
4. Wash once more with **200 µL MACS buffer**, centrifuge, and flick.

:::callout-note
All antibodies should be titrated for optimal performance. Default dilutions are provided as a starting point only.
:::

### 3.1 Surface staining only

1. Resuspend pellets in **100–200 µL 4% PFA in PBS**.
2. Store at **4 °C**, protected from light, until acquisition.

---

## Step 4 – Fixation and permeabilization

This step assumes use of:
- **BD Cytofix/Cytoperm** (cytoplasmic targets), or  
- **eBioscience FOXP3 fix/perm** (intranuclear targets).

### 4.1 Initial fixation/permeabilization

1. Add **100 µL** fix/perm solution per well.
2. Incubate **20 min on ice**, protected from light.
3. Top up to **200 µL** with 1× PermWash.
4. Centrifuge and flick.
5. Resuspend in **200 µL** PermWash.
6. Centrifuge and flick.

### 4.2 Optional pause point

1. Resuspend pellets in **200 µL MACS buffer**.
2. Store at **4 °C overnight**, protected from light.

:::callout-note
This pause point is compatible with most intracellular workflows, but antigen stability should be confirmed for each marker.
:::

---

## Step 5 – Intracellular or intranuclear staining

1. Prepare an **intracellular or intranuclear antibody master mix** in the appropriate **PermWash** buffer (kit-specific):
   - Final volume: **50 µL per well**
2. Resuspend each cell pellet in **50 µL** of the antibody master mix.
3. Incubate **30 min on ice**, protected from light, **or** incubate **overnight at 4 °C**.

:::callout-tip
For **intranuclear targets** (e.g. **FOXP3, Helios, T-bet, Eomes**), overnight antibody incubation at **4 °C** can improve signal intensity, particularly for low-abundance or epitope-masked transcription factors.  
Ensure plates are **well sealed, clearly labelled, and protected from light** during overnight incubation.
:::

:::callout-warning
Overnight antibody incubation is **not recommended for cytoplasmic intracellular targets** (e.g. cytokines, granzymes, perforin). Prolonged incubation can increase background staining and does not typically improve signal for these antigens. Use **30–60 min** incubations for intracellular (non-nuclear) targets.
:::

4. Top up each well to **200 µL** with PermWash.
5. Centrifuge and flick off the supernatant.
6. Wash once more with **200 µL PermWash**, centrifuge, and flick.
7. Resuspend each pellet in **100–200 µL 4% PFA in PBS**.
8. Store at **4 °C**, protected from light, until acquisition.
