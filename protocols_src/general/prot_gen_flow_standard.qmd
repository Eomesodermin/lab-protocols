# Purpose

This protocol describes a standard flow cytometry staining workflow for suspension cells, including:

- Surface staining with Fc block and live/dead dye.  
- Optional intracellular staining (e.g. BD Cytofix/Cytoperm-based).  
- Optional intranuclear staining (e.g. eBioscience FOXP3 fix/perm-based).

It is intended as a general framework for murine or human samples and can be adapted to specific panels and antibody combinations.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- Keep cells and antibody mixes cold (on ice or at 4 °C) and protected from light whenever possible.
- Use FACS buffer containing EDTA to reduce cell aggregation during staining and washing.
- Do not exceed the recommended maximum of ~5 × 10⁵ cells per well in 96-well plates to ensure effective staining and washing.
- Always include appropriate controls (unstained, live/dead only, FMO, single-colour controls, etc.) for panel design and compensation.
- Fixation and permeabilization conditions must be compatible with the antibodies and fluorochromes used (consult datasheets).
- If using commercial fixation/permeabilization kits, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for dilution and incubation times.

::: callout-warning
Improper fixation/permeabilization or using incompatible buffers can destroy epitopes and fluorochromes, leading to poor or misleading intracellular/intranuclear staining. Verify kit compatibility with your antibodies and fluorochromes before use.
:::

::: callout-tip
Where possible, stain surface markers (including live/dead) first, then fix and permeabilize for intracellular/intranuclear staining. This often yields more robust surface staining and simplifies panel design.
:::

# Approximate timing

- Plate setup and Fc block + live/dead: 20–30 min  
- Surface staining: 30–45 min  
- Fixation only (no intracellular): 15–20 min  
- Fix + permeabilization + intracellular/intranuclear staining (same day): 1.5–2 hours  
- Optional overnight pause (after initial fix/perm): adds 1 day  

**Total approximate time (surface only):** ~1 hour.  
**Total approximate time (full intracellular/intranuclear workflow):** ~3–4 hours over 1–2 days.

# Procedure

## Step 1 – Plate setup and FACS buffer

1. Prepare FACS buffer (BUF-GEN-FACS-BUF-001):  
   - PBS, 1×  
   - 2 % FCS (heat-inactivated)  
   - 2 mM EDTA  
2. Prepare single-cell suspensions of the desired samples.
3. Count cells and adjust concentration so that you can plate up to **5 × 10⁵ cells per well** of a 96-well U-bottom or V-bottom plate.
4. Aliquot cells into the plate (typically 5 × 10⁵ cells per well or less).
5. Keep plates on ice (or at 4 °C) until staining begins.

## Step 2 – Fc block and live/dead staining

1. Prepare a staining mix in FACS buffer containing Fc block and live/dead dye:

   - Fc block: **1:200** dilution.  
   - Live/dead dye: **1:100** dilution.  
   - Final volume: **50 µL per well**.

2. Add **50 µL** of this Fc block + live/dead mix to each well containing cells.
3. Gently tap or briefly pulse-centrifuge the plate if needed to ensure mixing.
4. Incubate on ice (or at 4 °C) for the time recommended by the live/dead reagent manufacturer (typically 15–20 min), protected from light.
5. Centrifuge the plate at **1000 g for 2 min**.
6. Quickly flick off the supernatant into a suitable waste container.

::: callout-warning
Live/dead dyes are light-sensitive and can be toxic at high concentrations or with prolonged incubation. Avoid direct light and adhere to the manufacturer’s recommended dilution and incubation times.
:::

## Step 3 – Surface staining

1. Prepare a surface staining master mix in FACS buffer with all desired surface antibodies:
   - Total volume: **50 µL per well**.
   - Antibody dilutions according to titration data (commonly 1:50–1:200).
2. Resuspend cell pellets in **50 µL** surface stain master mix per well.
3. Incubate the plate on ice for **30 min**, protected from light.
4. After incubation, top up each well to **200 µL** with FACS buffer.
5. Centrifuge the plate at **400 g for 2 min**.
6. Flick off the supernatant.
7. Wash the cells by adding **200 µL** FACS buffer to each well, gently resuspending the pellet, and centrifuging again at **400 g for 2 min**.
8. Flick off the supernatant.

### 3.1 If only surface staining is required

1. Resuspend each pellet in **100–200 µL** of 4 % PFA solution (or appropriate fixative) in PBS.
2. Store plates at 4 °C, protected from light, until acquisition.

## Step 4 – Fixation and permeabilization for intracellular or intranuclear staining

This step assumes the use of:

- **BD** intracellular staining kit (e.g. Cytofix/Cytoperm) for cytoplasmic targets, or  
- **eBioscience FOXP3** or equivalent intranuclear staining kit for transcription factors.

Always consult the kit manuals; the steps below mirror the original SOP structure.

### 4.1 Initial fix/perm

1. Add **100 µL** of BD fix/perm solution (e.g. Cytofix/Cytoperm) **or** eBioscience FOXP3 fix/perm solution (typically 1:4 concentrate with 3:4 diluent) to each well.
2. Incubate for **20 min on ice**, protected from light.
3. Top up each well to **200 µL** with 1× PermWash (diluted in water, according to the kit instructions).
4. Centrifuge the plate and flick off the supernatant.
5. Resuspend each pellet in **200 µL** 1× PermWash.
6. Centrifuge the plate and flick off the supernatant.

### 4.2 Pause point (optional, overnight)

1. Resuspend each pellet in **200 µL** FACS buffer.
2. Seal and label the plate clearly.
3. Store at **4 °C** overnight, protected from light.

::: callout-note
An overnight pause at this stage can be convenient for scheduling, but confirm that your antigen of interest and fluorochromes are stable under these conditions.
:::

### 4.3 Re-permeabilization before intranuclear staining (if using FOXP3 kit)

1. The following day, centrifuge the plate at **1000 g for 2 min** and flick off the supernatant.
2. Resuspend pellets in **200 µL** 1× PermWash (FOXP3 kit).
3. Incubate for **30 min on ice**, protected from light.
4. Centrifuge and flick off the supernatant.

## Step 5 – Intracellular or intranuclear staining

1. Prepare an intracellular or intranuclear staining master mix in the appropriate PermWash (kit-specific):
   - Total volume: **50 µL per well**.
   - Antibody dilutions according to titration data (typically 1:50–1:200).
2. Resuspend each pellet in **50 µL** of the master mix.
3. Incubate on ice for **30 min**, protected from light.
4. Top up each well to **200 µL** with PermWash.
5. Centrifuge and flick off the supernatant.
6. Wash once more with **200 µL** PermWash and centrifuge.
7. Flick off the supernatant.
8. Resuspend each pellet in **100–200 µL** of 4 % PFA solution (or other appropriate fixative) in PBS.
9. Store plates at 4 °C, protected from light, until acquisition.

# Troubleshooting

| Problem                                      | Possible cause                                        | Suggested solution                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High background staining                    | Antibody over-titration; inadequate washing; Fc block insufficient | Titrate antibodies; ensure thorough washes; increase Fc block if appropriate. |
| Poor separation of positive/negative populations | Suboptimal antibody concentration; insufficient incubation time | Re-titrate antibodies; extend incubation (e.g. up to 40–45 min).    |
| Extensive cell clumping                     | No EDTA; high cell density; dead cells present       | Use FACS buffer with EDTA; reduce cells per well; filter cells if necessary. |
| Poor intracellular/intranuclear staining    | Inadequate fixation/permeabilization; incompatible buffers | Confirm kit protocol; ensure correct fix/perm times; use recommended buffers. |
| Loss of surface staining after fixation     | Antibodies or epitopes not fixation-stable           | Move sensitive markers to “post-fixation” staining if compatible, or use fix-stable clones/fluorochromes. |
| Low viability                               | Over-handling; extended time at room temperature     | Minimize processing time; keep cells on ice when possible; avoid harsh pipetting. |

# Safety (brief)

- Handle all biological samples under appropriate biosafety conditions (e.g. BSL2) and follow institutional guidelines.
- Wear standard PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection) when handling cells, antibodies, and fixatives.
- 4 % PFA and commercial fixatives should be handled in a fume hood or well-ventilated area; avoid skin and eye contact.
- Dispose of plates, tubes, tips, and liquids contaminated with biological material or fixatives as chemical/biological hazardous waste according to local regulations.
