# Purpose

This protocol describes the thawing, routine culture, maintenance, passaging, and cryopreservation of the human K-562 erythroleukemia cell line. K-562 cells grow in suspension and require regular monitoring of density to maintain viability and consistent growth rates.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- K-562 cells grow as **suspension cultures** and should remain in exponential growth phase.
- Do not allow cultures to exceed recommended density, as nutrient depletion reduces viability and alters phenotype.
- K-562 cells are of human origin—treat all cultures and waste as BSL2.
- Always pre-warm media and reagents to **37 °C** before use.
- Ensure gentle handling; harsh centrifugation or over-pipetting can damage suspension cells.
- Cryopreservation requires **10% DMSO**, and cells should be frozen using a controlled-rate freezing container.

::: callout-warning
Overgrowth (tight clumps, very dense cultures) leads to poor viability and altered functional responses. Split cultures **before** they exceed recommended density.
:::

::: callout-tip
Record passage number and split ratios at every passage. This improves reproducibility when using K-562 cells as targets or stimulator cells.
:::

# Approximate timing

- Thawing: 15–20 min  
- Routine medium change / split: 10–15 min  
- Cryopreservation: 20–30 min  
- Total hands-on time per session: ~15–30 min

# Procedure

## Step 1 – Reagents and medium preparation

1. Pre-warm complete culture medium:
   - RPMI 1640  
   - 10% FCS  
   - 1% Pen/Strep  
2. Pre-warm PBS (if washing is needed).  
3. Label flasks with:
   - Cell line name (K-562)  
   - Passage number  
   - Date  
   - Operator initials  

## Step 2 – Thawing K-562 cells

1. Pre-warm **10–15 mL** of complete medium to 37 °C.
2. Thaw a cryovial of K-562 cells in a 37 °C water bath:
   - Gently swirl and remove when only a small ice crystal remains.
3. Transfer contents into a 15 mL tube containing **10 mL** pre-warmed complete medium.
4. Centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min** at room temperature.
5. Remove supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in **10–15 mL** fresh complete medium.
6. Transfer cells to a T25 or T75 flask and incubate at **37 °C, 5% CO₂**.

::: callout-note
The centrifugation step removes DMSO, preventing toxicity during recovery.
:::

## Step 3 – Routine culture and passaging

### Recommended density  
- Maintain between **2 × 10⁵** and **1 × 10⁶ cells/mL**.

### Procedure  
1. Gently resuspend the culture by pipetting up and down.
2. Count cells using trypan blue or an automated counter.
3. If density > 1 × 10⁶ cells/mL:
   - Split culture **1:2 to 1:5** depending on growth.
4. Add fresh, pre-warmed complete medium to adjust culture to:
   - **2–3 × 10⁵ cells/mL**
5. Return to incubator (37 °C, 5% CO₂).

::: callout-warning
Do not allow cultures to sit for more than 3–4 days without splitting. Nutrient depletion leads to apoptosis and growth arrest.
:::

## Step 4 – Short-term storage / holding conditions

- Cultures may be held at **2–4 × 10⁵ cells/mL** for 24–48 h without splitting.
- If cultures appear slow or viability drops:
  - Increase medium volume  
  - Spin down and resuspend in entirely fresh medium  

## Step 5 – Cryopreservation of K-562 cells

### Preparation of freezing medium
- **90% FCS + 10% DMSO**  
(or use BUF-GEN-FREEZE-MIX-001 diluted 1:1 with cell suspension)

### Freezing procedure

1. Collect cells in exponential growth phase.
2. Centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min**.
3. Resuspend in freezing medium at **1–10 × 10⁶ cells/mL**.
4. Aliquot **1 mL** into labelled cryovials.
5. Place vials into a **controlled-rate freezing container** (e.g. Mr Frosty).
6. Freeze at **−70/−80 °C overnight**.
7. Transfer vials to **liquid nitrogen** for long-term storage.
