# Purpose

This protocol describes the thawing, routine culture, maintenance, passaging, and cryopreservation of the human KHYG-1 NK-like cell line. KHYG-1 cells grow as a suspension culture and require IL-2 supplementation for optimal growth and function.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- KHYG-1 is a **human NK-like suspension cell line**; treat all material as BSL2.
- Maintain cultures in **logarithmic growth phase**; avoid overgrowth and nutrient depletion.
- IL-2 is required for optimal growth and should be **added fresh** to complete medium at each medium change.
- Always pre-warm media and PBS to **37 °C** before use.
- Avoid excessive centrifugation speeds and harsh pipetting to prevent cell damage.
- Use controlled-rate freezing and appropriate freezing medium for cryopreservation.

::: callout-warning
Failure to supplement medium with IL-2 or allowing cultures to overgrow can lead to reduced viability, altered phenotype, and inconsistent experimental results.
:::

::: callout-tip
Keep a simple culture log listing passage number, split ratio, IL-2 batch and concentration, and any deviations. This improves reproducibility across experiments.
:::

# Approximate timing

- Thawing: 15–20 min  
- Routine split/medium change: 10–20 min  
- Cryopreservation: 20–30 min  

**Total hands-on time per session:** ~15–30 min.

# Procedure

## Step 1 – Medium and reagent preparation

1. Prepare **KHYG-1 complete medium** based on R10 (BUF-GEN-R10-MED-001):
   - RPMI 1640  
   - 10% heat-inactivated FCS  
   - 1% Pen/Strep  
2. Prepare **IL-2 stock** according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Immediately before use, supplement complete medium with IL-2:
   - Final concentration: **100–200 IU/mL** (use a lab-validated concentration consistently).
4. Pre-warm:
   - KHYG-1 complete medium + IL-2  
   - PBS (if washing is needed)  
   to **37 °C**.

::: callout-note
IL-2 should not be stored long-term in medium; add fresh to pre-warmed R10 immediately before feeding or splitting cultures.
:::

## Step 2 – Thawing KHYG-1 cells

1. Remove a cryovial of KHYG-1 cells from liquid nitrogen and immediately place it in a **37 °C water bath**.
2. Gently swirl the vial until only a small ice crystal remains (1–2 min).
3. Disinfect the outside of the vial with 70% ethanol and transfer to a biosafety cabinet.
4. Transfer the vial contents to a 15 mL tube containing **9–10 mL** pre-warmed KHYG-1 complete medium **without IL-2** to dilute DMSO.
5. Centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min** at room temperature.
6. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.
7. Resuspend the cell pellet gently in **10–15 mL** pre-warmed KHYG-1 complete medium **with IL-2**.
8. Transfer cells to an appropriate flask (e.g. T25 or T75).
9. Place the flask in a **37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator**.

::: callout-warning
Do not leave cells in freezing medium (DMSO-containing) after thawing. Wash promptly to minimise DMSO toxicity.
:::

## Step 3 – Routine culture and passaging

### Recommended density range

- Maintain cultures between approximately **2 × 10⁵** and **1 × 10⁶ cells/mL**.

### Monitoring and splitting

1. Gently resuspend the culture by pipetting up and down or gently swirling the flask.
2. Remove a small aliquot for counting and viability assessment.
3. If the cell density exceeds **1 × 10⁶ cells/mL**, split the culture:
   - Remove a defined volume of culture (e.g. half to three-quarters of the flask volume).
   - Replace with an equal volume of **fresh pre-warmed KHYG-1 medium with IL-2**.
   - This corresponds to approximately a **1:2–1:4 split**, depending on growth.
4. Aim to re-establish cultures at **2–3 × 10⁵ cells/mL** after splitting.
5. Return flasks to the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO₂).

### Medium change for lower-density cultures

- If cells are at acceptable density but medium appears acidic or exhausted:
  1. Gently resuspend cells.  
  2. Transfer to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min**.  
  3. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in fresh medium with IL-2 at the desired density.  
  4. Return to flask and incubator.

::: callout-note
Maintain consistent IL-2 concentrations at each passage and medium change. Record IL-2 lot numbers for traceability.
:::

## Step 4 – Short-term maintenance and experimental setup

1. For experiments, seed KHYG-1 cells at a defined density consistent with experimental requirements (e.g. **2–3 × 10⁵ cells/mL**).
2. Use fresh medium with IL-2 on the day before and the day of the experiment to ensure cells are in active growth phase.
3. Avoid using cultures older than a defined passage number (e.g. **>20–25 passages** post-thaw) for critical experiments; restart from frozen stock as needed.

## Step 5 – Cryopreservation of KHYG-1 cells

### Freezing medium

- Standard freezing medium for KHYG-1:
  - **90% FCS + 10% DMSO**  
  or  
  - Cell suspension in R10 mixed 1:1 with **BUF-GEN-FREEZE-MIX-001** (2× freezing medium) to yield final 10% DMSO.

### Freezing procedure

1. Ensure KHYG-1 cells are in exponential growth phase (healthy, non-overgrown cultures).
2. Transfer the culture to a 15 or 50 mL tube and centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min**.
3. Aspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in freezing medium at **5–10 × 10⁶ cells/mL**.
4. Aliquot **1 mL** of cell suspension per labelled cryovial (include cell line name, passage number, date, and your initials).
5. Place vials into a **controlled-rate freezing container** (e.g. Mr Frosty).
6. Freeze at **−70/−80 °C** for at least **12–24 hours**.
7. Transfer vials to **liquid nitrogen** for long-term storage.

::: callout-warning
Avoid extended handling of cells at room temperature in freezing medium; DMSO is toxic and should be minimised outside of the controlled freezing process.
