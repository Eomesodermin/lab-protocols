# Purpose

This protocol describes thawing, routine culture, IL-2–supplemented maintenance, passaging, and cryopreservation of the **human NK-92 cell line**. NK-92 is a suspension NK-like cell line requiring continuous IL-2 supplementation for viability, proliferation, and maintenance of cytotoxic phenotype.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- NK-92 is a **human clinical-grade NK cell line** and must be handled under strict BSL2 conditions.
- NK-92 requires **continuous IL-2 supplementation** for survival. Never culture NK-92 in IL-2–free medium.
- NK-92 is typically cultured at **200–500 IU/mL IL-2** (lab-validated range should be consistent).
- NK-92 grows in suspension but forms **loose aggregates**; avoid over-pipetting or harsh centrifugation.
- Passage NK-92 before cultures become dense or acidic; overgrown cultures lose cytotoxicity and viability.
- Cryopreserved NK-92 must be thawed quickly and washed immediately to remove DMSO.

::: callout-warning
NK-92 viability rapidly decreases if IL-2 is omitted or if medium becomes depleted. Always add IL-2 fresh to pre-warmed medium before feeding or splitting.
:::

::: callout-tip
For reproducibility, record IL-2 batch number, concentration added, split ratio, and passage number at every passage.
:::

# Approximate timing

- Thawing: 15–20 min  
- Routine maintenance and splitting: 10–20 min  
- Cryopreservation: 20–30 min  
- Hands-on time per culture session: ~15–30 min

# Procedure

## Step 1 – Medium and reagent preparation

1. Prepare complete NK-92 medium:
   - RPMI 1640  
   - 10% heat-inactivated FCS  
   - 1% Pen/Strep  
2. Prepare IL-2 working aliquots.
3. Supplement complete medium with IL-2 immediately before use:
   - **200 IU/mL** final (or your lab-validated concentration).
4. Pre-warm:
   - NK-92 complete medium + IL-2  
   - PBS (if washing is needed)  
   to **37 °C**.

::: callout-note
IL-2 is unstable when stored in complete medium. Always add fresh, immediately before feeding.
:::

## Step 2 – Thawing NK-92 cells

1. Remove a cryovial from liquid nitrogen and place immediately in a **37 °C water bath**.
2. Gently swirl until only a small ice crystal remains.
3. Disinfect the vial and transfer to a biosafety cabinet.
4. Transfer the contents to a 15 mL tube containing **9–10 mL** pre-warmed medium **without IL-2** to dilute DMSO.
5. Centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min**.
6. Carefully aspirate supernatant.
7. Gently resuspend the pellet in **10–15 mL** NK-92 complete medium **with IL-2**.
8. Transfer cells to a T25 or T75 flask and incubate at **37 °C, 5% CO₂**.

::: callout-warning
Do not expose thawed cells to DMSO for more than a few minutes; wash immediately after thawing.
:::

## Step 3 – Routine culture and passaging

### Recommended density

- Maintain cultures between **2 × 10⁵** and **1 × 10⁶ cells/mL**.

### Procedure

1. Gently pipette or swirl flask to resuspend cells uniformly.
2. Remove an aliquot for counting and viability.
3. If density exceeds **1 × 10⁶ cells/mL**, split culture:
   - Remove part of the culture (e.g., ½–¾ volume).
   - Replace with fresh NK-92 medium + IL-2.
4. Restore cultures to **2–3 × 10⁵ cells/mL**.
5. Return flasks to incubator.

### Full medium change for stressed cultures

1. Collect cells and centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min**.
2. Aspirate depleted medium.
3. Resuspend cells in fresh complete NK-92 medium + IL-2.

::: callout-note
Fresh IL-2 medium is essential after any decline in viability; NK-92 responds rapidly to improved culture conditions.
:::

## Step 4 – Preparing NK-92 cells for experiments

1. For functional assays, activate cultures 24 hours before experiments using:
   - Fresh NK-92 complete medium + IL-2  
2. Seed cultures at defined densities (e.g., **2–3 × 10⁵ cells/mL**).
3. Avoid using NK-92 beyond a set passage number (e.g., **<20 passages** post-thaw).

## Step 5 – Cryopreservation of NK-92 cells

### Freezing medium

- **90% FCS + 10% DMSO**, or  
- Mix cell suspension 1:1 with **BUF-GEN-FREEZE-MIX-001** for a final 10% DMSO freezing medium.

### Procedure

1. Harvest NK-92 cells during exponential growth.
2. Centrifuge at **300 g for 5 min**.
3. Resuspend cells at **5–10 × 10⁶ cells/mL** in freezing medium.
4. Aliquot **1 mL** per labelled cryovial.
5. Place into a **controlled-rate freezing container** (Mr Frosty).
6. Freeze at **−70/−80 °C** for ≥12 hours.
7. Transfer to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.

| Slow growth                   | Insufficient IL-2; old medium                   | Increase IL-2 (within validated range); refresh medium    |
| Excessive clumping            | Overgrowth or nutrient depletion                | Split earlier; replace medium entirely                    |
| Reduced cytotoxicity          | High passage number; inconsistent IL-2          | Use low-passage cells; standardise IL-2 concentration     |
| Contamination                 | Aseptic technique failure                       | Discard culture and restart from frozen stock             |

# Safety (brief)

- NK-92 is a human-derived cell line and must be handled under **BSL2**.  
- Wear gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.  
- Dispose of all culture waste as biohazardous.  
- Handle DMSO cautiously; it increases dermal absorption of contaminants.  
- Follow institutional protocols for cryogen handling and LN₂ storage.
