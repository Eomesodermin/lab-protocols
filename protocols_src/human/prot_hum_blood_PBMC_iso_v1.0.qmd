# Purpose

This protocol describes the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole human blood using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Whole blood is diluted with serum-free medium (R0), layered onto Ficoll, centrifuged to generate a mononuclear cell interface, and PBMCs are harvested, washed, and optionally cryopreserved in freezing medium.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- Handle human blood and PBMCs as potentially infectious material under appropriate biosafety conditions (e.g. BSL2).
- Carefully layer diluted blood onto Ficoll to avoid mixing; a sharp interface is essential for good yield and purity.
- Use **rcf (g)** where possible rather than rpm; if rpm is used, ensure it corresponds to the correct g-force for your rotor.
- Use low brake (or reduced deceleration) during the Ficoll spin to avoid disturbing the gradient.
- Avoid aspirating Ficoll when harvesting the PBMC layer; take only the “fluffy” interface.
- Keep cells at room temperature during the Ficoll separation and at room temperature or 4 °C during washes, as appropriate.
- For cryopreservation, use controlled-rate freezing (e.g. Mr Frosty) and avoid leaving cells at room temperature with DMSO for prolonged periods.

::: callout-warning
Mixing of diluted blood with Ficoll or using high brake during the gradient centrifugation can collapse the interface and dramatically reduce PBMC yield and purity.
:::

::: callout-tip
Prepare all R0 and R10 media, Ficoll tubes, and pre-labelled cryovials before starting. This simplifies handling once blood is collected and reduces the time PBMCs spend at room temperature.
:::

# Approximate timing

- Setup and blood dilution: 10–15 min  
- Ficoll gradient and spin: 30 min  
- First PBMC wash: 15–20 min  
- Second wash and resuspension in R10: 15–20 min  
- Counting and freezing (if applicable): 20–30 min  

**Total approximate time:** 1.5–2 hours.

# Procedure

## Step 1 – Tube labelling and blood dilution

1. Label 50 mL conical tubes for each blood sample.
2. For each sample, add whole blood to a 50 mL tube:
   - Transfer up to **17.5 mL whole blood** per 50 mL tube.
3. Dilute blood **1:2** with R0 medium (RPMI without FCS; BUF-GEN-R0-MED-001):
   - Add **17.5 mL R0** to 17.5 mL blood (total 35 mL).  
   - If using less than 17.5 mL blood, top up to **35 mL** with R0.

::: callout-note
Dilution with R0 reduces viscosity, improves layering on Ficoll, and can improve separation quality.
:::

## Step 2 – Ficoll layering and gradient centrifugation

1. In a fresh 50 mL tube, add **10 mL Ficoll** (density gradient medium).
2. Using a 10 mL serological pipette, **slowly overlay** the **35 mL diluted blood** onto the Ficoll:
   - Hold the Ficoll tube at a gentle angle.
   - Carefully dispense the diluted blood onto the Ficoll surface, avoiding mixing.
   - Maximum volume of diluted blood per tube: **35 mL**.
3. Prepare all Ficoll gradients required and ensure they are balanced.
4. Centrifuge at **450 g (rcf)** for **30 min** at room temperature with:
   - Acceleration: 2  
   - Deceleration: 1 (minimal brake)
5. During centrifugation, prepare **10 mL tubes** containing **3 mL R0** (2 tubes per Ficoll gradient) for PBMC collection.

## Step 3 – Harvest of PBMC layer and first wash

1. After centrifugation, identify:
   - Plasma / diluted medium layer on top.
   - A white, “fluffy” PBMC layer at the plasma/Ficoll interface.
   - Ficoll layer.
   - Pellet of erythrocytes and granulocytes at the bottom.
2. Using a sterile transfer pipette, gently harvest the PBMC layer:
   - Carefully aspirate the interface and transfer to a 10 mL tube containing **3 mL R0**.
   - Continue until the visible fluffy layer is removed.
3. For each gradient, distribute the collected PBMCs across **two 10 mL tubes** (each with 3 mL R0).
4. Centrifuge the 10 mL tubes at **400 g for 10 min** at room temperature:
   - Acceleration: 9  
   - Deceleration: 9
5. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellets.

## Step 4 – Second wash and resuspension in R10

1. Resuspend each PBMC pellet in **3 mL R0**.
2. Combine **two pellets into one tube** and top up to **10 mL R0**.
3. Centrifuge at **400 g for 5 min** at room temperature:
   - Acceleration: 9  
   - Deceleration: 9
4. Remove and discard the supernatant.
5. Resuspend the pellet in **10 mL R10** (complete RPMI with 10 % FCS; BUF-GEN-R10-MED-001).
6. If multiple gradients were processed for the same sample, combine their PBMC pellets into a single tube in R10.
7. Centrifuge at **400 g for 5 min** at room temperature.
8. Remove and discard the supernatant.
9. Resuspend the pellet in **1–10 mL R10**, depending on pellet size and planned downstream use.

## Step 5 – Counting and cryopreservation (optional)

1. Mix the cell suspension gently and take a small aliquot for counting with trypan blue or an equivalent viability dye.
2. Calculate the total number of viable PBMCs.
3. For cryopreservation, aim for a final concentration of **10 × 10⁶ cells/mL** per cryovial.

### 5.1 Preparation of 2× freezing medium (BUF-GEN-FREEZE-MIX-001)

1. Prepare 2× freezing medium by mixing:
   - 7 mL R0  
   - 1 mL FCS  
   - 2 mL DMSO  
   (Final: R0 + 10 % FCS + 20 % DMSO; 2× relative to standard 10 % DMSO freezing medium.)
2. Keep the 2× freezing medium on ice and protected from light.

### 5.2 Adjust cell concentration and freeze

1. Adjust PBMCs in R10 to **20 × 10⁶ cells/mL**:
   - If only one cryovial is needed, pellet cells at **200 g for 5 min**, remove supernatant, and resuspend so that the cell pellet is in **500 µL R10** (20 × 10⁶ cells/mL).
2. Add an **equal volume** of 2× freezing medium (BUF-GEN-FREEZE-MIX-001) to the cells:
   - Final concentration: **10 × 10⁶ cells/mL** in **10 % DMSO**.
3. Gently mix to avoid bubbles.
4. Dispense **1 mL** of cell suspension into **pre-cooled cryovials**, labelled with:
   - Patient name or anonymised ID.
   - Sample type (PBMC).
   - Date.
5. Place cryovials into a **pre-cooled controlled-rate freezing container** (e.g. Mr Frosty) and transfer to a **−70 °C or −80 °C** freezer.
6. After at least **overnight freezing**, move cryovials to **liquid nitrogen** for long-term storage.

|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Poor PBMC layer formation                 | Blood and Ficoll mixed; incorrect centrifuge settings | Carefully overlay blood; verify 450 g; reduce brake to minimal      |
| Low PBMC yield                            | Interface harvested too shallow or too deep        | Practice aspirating only the fluffy interface; avoid Ficoll and pellet |
| High granulocyte or RBC contamination     | Interface disturbed; Ficoll aspiration             | Harvest more gently; leave a thin Ficoll layer above the pellet     |
| PBMC clumping                             | High cell concentration; extended room temperature time | Gently resuspend; consider DNase during processing; shorten handling time |
| Reduced viability after thawing           | Inadequate freezing rate or DMSO handling          | Use controlled-rate freezing; minimize time with DMSO at room temperature |
| Loss of cells during washes               | Pellets disturbed when decanting                   | Leave a small volume above the pellet; decant carefully; use pipette to remove residual supernatant |
