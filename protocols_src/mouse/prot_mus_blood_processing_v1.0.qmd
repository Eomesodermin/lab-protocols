**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This protocol describes the processing of mouse peripheral blood collected in EDTA to generate a leukocyte-enriched single-cell suspension using RBC lysis and gentle washing. The final suspension is suitable for flow cytometry, basic immunophenotyping, and other standard immunological assays.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- Always collect blood into tubes containing **EDTA** (or other approved anticoagulant) and **mix immediately** to prevent clotting.
- Perform all processing steps as soon as possible after collection; avoid prolonged storage at room temperature.
- RBC lysis should be **time-limited (~5 minutes)** to minimise leukocyte damage.
- Keep samples on **ice** or at **4 °C** after lysis and during washing to preserve viability.

# Approximate timing

- Blood collection and transfer: **2–5 min per mouse**
- Initial spin and serum removal: **5 min**
- RBC lysis and wash: **10–15 min**

Total hands-on time per sample: **20–25 minutes**, depending on batching.

# Procedure

## STEP 1 – Blood collection

1. Prepare **EDTA-containing microcentrifuge tubes** (20–40 μL EDTA per tube) and label one tube per mouse.
2. Collect blood using an **insulin syringe** (or other approved method, e.g. retro-orbital, submandibular, cardiac puncture as per ethics approval).
3. Immediately dispense the blood into the EDTA tube.
4. Flick the tube gently to mix blood with EDTA and prevent clotting.

::: callout-warning
Ensure local ethics approval covers the chosen blood collection method. Handle sharps carefully and discard immediately into an approved sharps container.
:::

## STEP 2 – Allocate sample volume and initial spin

1. Transfer a defined volume of well-mixed whole blood (e.g. **100–200 μL**, or as required) from the EDTA tube into a **new, labelled microcentrifuge tube**.  
   - Record the volume used per sample in your lab notebook.
2. Centrifuge the whole blood at **maximum g (bench-top microcentrifuge)** for **5 minutes** at room temperature or 4 °C.
3. Carefully remove the **serum**:
   - Discard, or
   - Aliquot and freeze at **−20 °C or −80 °C** if required for serum analyses.

## STEP 3 – RBC lysis

1. Gently resuspend the remaining blood pellet in **1 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer** (e.g. BioLegend / HybriMax 1×).  
2. Transfer the suspension to a **15 mL Falcon tube**.
3. Gently mix by inversion or brief pipetting to ensure complete resuspension.
4. Incubate for **5 minutes at room temperature**.

::: callout-warning
Do not exceed the recommended lysis time; prolonged exposure to RBC lysis buffer can damage leukocytes and alter marker expression.
:::

## STEP 4 – Wash and final resuspension

1. After the 5-minute lysis, top up the tube to **10 mL** with **FACS/MACS Buffer**.
2. Centrifuge at **400 g for 4–5 minutes at 4 °C**.
3. Carefully pour off or aspirate the supernatant.
4. If substantial red cell contamination remains:
   - Repeat the RBC lysis step (STEP 3) once more, followed by the wash in STEP 4.
5. Finally, resuspend the cell pellet in an appropriate volume of **FACS/MACS Buffer** (e.g. **0.5–1 mL**) for:
   - Flow cytometry staining
   - Cell counting
   - Other downstream assays

Keep the cell suspension on **ice** until staining.

# Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible cause | Suggested solution |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample clotted | Delayed mixing with EDTA | Mix immediately after blood collection; discard clotted samples |
| Persistent red tinge after lysis | Incomplete RBC lysis | Repeat lysis once; do not extend lysis time excessively |
| Low leukocyte recovery | Pellet loss during washes | Pour supernatants slowly; consider aspirating instead |
| Poor viability | Prolonged room-temperature handling | Keep samples cold; minimise processing time |

# Safety (brief)

- Treat all mouse blood as potentially infectious; follow S1/S2 biosafety rules.
- Use appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection) and handle sharps with care.
- RBC lysis buffers may contain toxic components (e.g. ammonium chloride, azide); avoid contact with skin and eyes and dispose of waste according to institutional chemical safety guidelines.
