**Protocol ID:** {{< meta protocol_id >}}  
**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This protocol describes the isolation of bone marrow cells from mouse long bones (typically femurs and tibias) by flushing with buffer, mechanical dispersion, and optional RBC lysis. The resulting suspension is suitable for flow cytometry, FACS sorting, and functional assays.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- Work on **ice** or at **4 °C** after marrow isolation to preserve viability.
- Keep bones **moist at all times** in cold buffer; do not allow them to dry.
- Use fresh, sterile instruments and avoid introducing bone shards into the final suspension.
- If erythrocyte content is high, perform **controlled RBC lysis**; avoid prolonged exposure to lysis buffer.

# Approximate timing

- Bone dissection: **10–15 min per mouse** (faster when batching)
- Marrow flushing and dispersion: **10–15 min**
- RBC lysis and washing: **10–15 min**

Total hands-on time per mouse: **30–45 minutes**, depending on experience and batching.

# Procedure

## STEP 1 – Bone collection

1. Euthanise the mouse using an approved method.
2. Spray the hind limbs with **70% ethanol** and transfer the carcass to a sterile working area (e.g. Class II biosafety cabinet, if available).
3. Dissect out **femurs** using scissors and forceps.
4. Remove all excess muscle and connective tissue from the bones.
5. Place cleaned bones in a 50 mL tube or petri dish containing **cold FACS Buffer or PBS** and keep on ice.

## STEP 2 – Bone marrow extraction

### Method 1 - Flushing the bone marrow

1. In a petri dish or on a sterile surface, cut off the **epiphyses** (ends) of each bone with sterile scissors to expose the marrow cavity.
2. Fill a **10 mL syringe** fitted with an appropriate gauge needle (e.g. 25 G) with **cold FACS Buffer or PBS**.
3. Position the needle into one end of the bone and flush the marrow into a **petri dish** or **50 mL tube**:
   - Use ~1–3 mL buffer per bone, depending on size.
4. Repeat flushing from both ends if necessary until the bone appears pale and empty.
5. Gently triturate the flushed marrow with a **5–10 mL pipette** or by drawing up and down with the syringe (without needle) to break up clumps.

::: callout-warning
Avoid vigorous pipetting that shears cells; use gentle, repeated strokes to obtain a single-cell suspension.

### Method 2 - Centrifugation

1. Poke a small hole (using a needle) in a PCR tube
2. Place PCR tube in an Eppendorf tube
3. Add 200 µL cold **FACS Buffer**
4. Cut off the **epiphyses** (ends) of each bone with sterile scissors to expose the marrow cavity.
5. Spin in table-top micro-centrifuge for 30 sec - 2 mins 
6. Ensure bone marrow has not gotten stuck in the PCR tube and bones appear pale and empty (Repeat spin as needed)


## STEP 3 – Filtration and initial wash

1. Pass sample through a **70 µm cell strainer** onto a **15 mL Falcon tube**.
2. Rinse the petri dish/source tube and strainer with additional cold **FACS Buffer** to collect remaining cells and top up to **15 mL**.
3. Centrifuge at **400 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C**.
4. Carefully discard the supernatant.

## STEP 4 – RBC lysis (if required)

1. Gently resuspend the bone marrow pellet in **100 µL 1× RBC Lysis Buffer** (e.g. HybriMax or equivalent).
2. Incubate for **5 minutes at room temperature**, gently inverting the tube once or twice.

::: callout-warning
Do not exceed 5 minutes of RBC lysis; prolonged exposure can reduce leukocyte viability and alter surface marker expression.
:::

3. After lysis, immediately top up the tube to **10 mL** with **FACS Buffer**.
4. Centrifuge at **400 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C**.
5. Carefully discard the supernatant.

## STEP 5 – Final wash and resuspension

1. Resuspend cells in **1 mL FACS Buffer** (adjust volume according to desired final concentration and downstream application).
2. Gently flick or briefly vortex to loosen the pellet.
3. If residual clumping is observed, pass the suspension again through a **70 µm strainer** into a fresh tube.
4. Keep the suspension on **ice** until counting, staining, or further processing.

## STEP 6 – Downstream applications

Proceed to:

- Cell counting and viability assessment.
- Flow cytometry staining panels (e.g. hematopoietic profiling).
- FACS sorting (e.g. HSCs, progenitors, mature lineages).
- Functional assays or in vitro culture as per experimental design.

# Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible cause | Suggested solution |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Low cell yield | Incomplete marrow flushing | Flush from both ends; increase volume per bone slightly |
| Excess debris or bone fragments | Inadequate filtration | Ensure proper use of 70 µm strainer; repeat filtration if needed |
| High red cell contamination | Insufficient RBC lysis | Repeat RBC lysis briefly (≤3 min) followed by wash |
| Poor viability | Overly vigorous trituration or long RT handling | Use gentler pipetting; keep steps cold; minimise processing time |
