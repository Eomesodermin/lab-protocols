# Purpose

This protocol describes a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for measuring lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) RNA in mouse serum and tissues, adapted from McCausland and Crotty, J Virol Methods 2008. The assay uses gene-specific reverse transcription with SuperScript III and SYBR Green qPCR targeting the GP segment, which provides improved specificity and sensitivity compared with NP-based assays.

## LCMV biosafety and handling

LCMV is a zoonotic arenavirus capable of causing severe disease in humans, including meningitis and congenital infection. Work with live LCMV must:

-   Be conducted under the appropriate institutional **biosafety level (typically BSL-2 with additional local conditions)** and approved animal and biosafety protocols.
-   Use **dedicated infectious CO₂ incubators** and clearly labelled containment for all cultures and waste.
-   Include suitable **PPE** (lab coat/gown, gloves, eye protection as appropriate) and measures to avoid sharps injuries, aerosol formation, and spills.
-   Exclude or take special precautions for **pregnant or immunocompromised personnel** according to institutional policies.

All waste (liquid and solid) must be inactivated according to local regulations (e.g. chemical disinfection and/or autoclaving) **before** disposal.

# Principle

-   Total RNA is isolated from serum or homogenized tissue.
-   cDNA is generated using SuperScript III and a gene-specific primer (GP-R).
-   qPCR is performed with SYBR Green detection using GP-specific primers (GP-F and GP-R).
-   Absolute viral RNA copy numbers are calculated from a plasmid standard curve containing the LCMV GP gene (e.g. pSG5-GP).

# Sample Types

-   Serum (typically 50 uL per sample).
-   Tissue homogenates:
    -   Spleen: 10 mg
    -   Liver: 50 mg
    -   Kidney: 50 mg
    -   Brain: 50 mg
    -   Lymph node: 5 mg

All values are taken from the Methods section of McCausland & Crotty. Samples were snap-frozen on dry ice at harvest and stored at -80 C until RNA extraction.

# Reagents and Consumables

-   LCMV-infected mouse tissues or serum.
-   RNAqueous Mini Kit (Ambion) or equivalent silica spin-column RNA kit.
-   SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).
-   iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) or similar SYBR Green master mix with ROX passive reference.
-   Gene-specific primers (see below).
-   Plasmid standard containing the LCMV GP gene (e.g. pSG5-GP).
-   Nuclease-free water.
-   1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
-   0.2 mL PCR tubes or 96-well qPCR plates with optical seals.

# Equipment

-   Tissue homogenizer (e.g. Tissuemiser or similar rotor-stator homogenizer).
-   Microcentrifuge (refrigerated).
-   Class II biosafety cabinet or laminar flow hood.
-   qPCR instrument capable of SYBR Green detection (e.g. ABI GeneAmp 5700 or equivalent).
-   Standard laboratory pipettes and filtered tips.
-   -80 C freezer.

# Primers

All primer sequences are taken from the "LCMV viral load quantitative PCR (QPCR)" Methods section.

Recommended **GP primers (optimized set)**:

-   GP-F (S 877–901):\
    `CATTCACCTGGACTTTGTCAGACTC`

-   GP-R (S 970–991):\
    `GCAACTGCTGTGTTCCCGAAAC`

Alternative NP-based primer sets (historical, not recommended for new assays):

-   NP2-F (S 2601–2623):\
    `CAGAAATGTTGATGCTGGACTGC`

-   NP2-R (S 2697–2720):\
    `CAGACCTTGGCTTGCTTTACACAG`

Use GP-F and GP-R for all new experiments unless you have a specific reason to reproduce NP-based data.

# Primer Stocks

-   Prepare 100 uM stocks of GP-F and GP-R in nuclease-free water.
-   Prepare 10 uM working stocks for routine use.

# Sample Collection

1.  **Serum**
    -   Collect whole blood via retro-orbital bleed under appropriate anesthesia (e.g. isoflurane).
    -   Use heparinized capillary tubes.
    -   Transfer to 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge 20 min at 12,000 g, 4 C.
    -   Aliquot serum (minimum 50 uL) and store at -80 C.
2.  **Tissues**
    -   Harvest tissues with sterile instruments.
    -   Wipe instruments with 70 percent ethanol between mice and always process uninfected controls first.
    -   For qPCR, immediately snap-freeze small tissue pieces on dry ice.
    -   Store at -80 C.

# RNA Isolation

Based on RNAqueous Mini Kit usage:

1.  Thaw serum or tissue on ice.
2.  For serum:
    -   Use 50 uL serum directly in the kit lysis buffer according to manufacturer instructions.
3.  For tissues:
    -   Weigh 5–50 mg tissue into appropriate tubes.
    -   Add lysis buffer from the RNAqueous kit.
    -   Homogenize thoroughly with a rotor-stator homogenizer.
4.  **Critical decontamination step for homogenizer** between samples:
    -   Wash once with PBS.
    -   Wash once with 10 percent bleach.
    -   Wash once again with PBS.
    -   Do not rely on ethanol + PBS alone; this was reported as insufficient to prevent cross-contamination.
5.  Proceed with the RNAqueous spin-column protocol.
6.  Elute RNA in **20 uL** nuclease-free water.
7.  Store RNA at -80 C until use.

# cDNA Synthesis (Reverse Transcription)

Using SuperScript III and gene-specific priming:

1.  For each sample, set up a **20 uL** RT reaction containing:
    -   10 uL RNA (from the 20 uL eluate).
    -   1 gene-specific primer (usually GP-R at 0.5–1 uM final).
    -   dNTPs (as supplied or 0.5 mM each).
    -   Reaction buffer and DTT per SuperScript III instructions.
    -   SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (as per manufacturer recommendation, often 200 U per reaction).
2.  Incubate:
    -   55 C for 60 min (50 C can also be used but 55 C is preferred in the paper for specificity).
    -   Then inactivate at 70 C for 15 min or according to kit instructions.
3.  Include:
    -   At least two tissue-matched RNA samples from uninfected mice (negative controls).
    -   No-template control (water instead of RNA).
4.  Store cDNA at -20 C if not used immediately.

# qPCR Reaction Setup

Standard reaction (25 uL total volume):

-   5 uL cDNA template.
-   12.5 uL iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (2x).
-   0.5 uL GP-F (10 uM; final 0.2 uM).
-   0.5 uL GP-R (10 uM; final 0.2 uM).
-   6.5 uL nuclease-free water.

Notes: - 50 uL reactions can also be used; scale reagents proportionally. - Prepare a master mix for all wells to minimise pipetting error. - Run all samples in **duplicate**.

# qPCR Cycling Conditions

On ABI GeneAmp 5700 or similar:

-   Initial denaturation: 95 C, 3 min (or per master mix recommendations).
-   40 cycles of:
    -   95 C, 15 s
    -   60 C, 30 s (combined annealing/extension; fluorescence read step)

After amplification, perform a melt-curve analysis to verify a single specific product.

# Plasmid Standard Curve

1.  Use a plasmid containing the LCMV GP gene (e.g. pSG5-GP).
2.  Linearize the plasmid with an appropriate restriction enzyme.
3.  Quantify DNA by gel electrophoresis against known DNA standards.
4.  Convert mass to copy number using molecular weight.
5.  Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions covering the desired range (e.g. 10\^7 to 10\^0 genome copies per reaction).
6.  Aliquot each dilution and store at -80 C (single-use aliquots).
7.  In every run:
    -   Thaw a fresh aliquot series.
    -   Run each standard in duplicate.
8.  Generate a Ct vs log10(copy number) standard curve; R\^2 should typically be \> 0.98.

# Data Analysis

1.  For each plate, fit a linear regression of Ct versus log10(copy number) using the plasmid standards.
2.  For each sample, convert Ct to copy number using the standard curve.
3.  Correct for:
    -   Fraction of RNA used (10 uL of 20 uL).
    -   Volume or mass of starting material.
4.  Report viral load as:
    -   LCMV RNA copies per mL serum, or
    -   LCMV RNA copies per mg tissue.
5.  Limit of detection:
    -   The assay reproducibly detects approximately 1–5 LCMV genomes per qPCR reaction.
    -   In practice, set a Ct cutoff at 35–36 cycles; values above this should be considered below detection limit or flagged as unreliable.
6.  Use negative controls (uninfected tissue and no-template wells) to define background; any sample with signal overlapping control levels should be treated as negative.

# Controls and QC

Include in every run:

-   No-template controls (water instead of cDNA).
-   At least two uninfected control tissue samples per tissue type.
-   A positive control cDNA sample from a known LCMV-positive tissue.
-   Full plasmid standard curve.

Check:

-   Single peak in melt curve for all positive wells.
-   No amplification in no-template controls within the Ct window used for positivity.

# Notes and Tips

-   Work in a laminar flow hood where possible; use UV decontamination between runs.
-   Handle plasmid standards last and avoid placing them adjacent to unknown samples on the plate.
-   For very high viral loads, a 1:200 dilution of cDNA may be required to bring Ct values into the dynamic range of the standard curve.

# Safety considerations

-   Confirm that all work with LCMV and infected animals/samples is covered by approved **biosafety and animal use protocols**.
-   Perform all live-virus manipulations (thawing virus stocks, infection steps, handling of unfixed plates) in a **certified Class II biosafety cabinet**.
-   Use **dedicated infectious incubators** and clearly label plates, flasks, and waste containers with the virus strain and date.
-   Wear appropriate **PPE** at all times (lab coat/gown, gloves, eye/face protection as required).
-   Decontaminate all liquid waste (e.g. with freshly prepared bleach) before disposal. Solid waste (tips, plates, tubes) must be autoclaved or otherwise inactivated according to institutional guidelines.
-   OPD and its solutions are handled as **chemical hazardous waste**; follow chemical safety rules in addition to biosafety rules.
-   Pregnant or immunocompromised personnel should not work with LCMV unless explicitly allowed under institutional policy with additional safeguards.
