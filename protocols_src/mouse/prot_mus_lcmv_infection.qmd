**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This protocol describes standardized mouse infection procedures using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), with primary emphasis on **LCMV-WE** and **LCMV-Clone 13**, and additional reference to **LCMV-Docile** and **LCMV-Armstrong**.

The protocol defines virus handling, dilution, injection parameters, infection doses, and sampling windows, with specific annotation of **liver NLC (NK-like cell) dynamics** to guide optimal experimental design.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

-   All LCMV work must be performed under **approved animal and biosafety protocols**.
-   Virus stocks must be **titered, aliquoted, and freeze–thaw limited**.
-   Infection dose and route strongly influence antigen load and immune kinetics.
-   **NLC dynamics differ markedly between WE and Clone 13**, requiring strain-specific sampling strategies.
-   Late timepoints (> day 7) in Clone 13 infection are **suboptimal for NLC-focused analyses**.

# Approximate timing

- Virus thawing and dilution: **5–10 min**
- Intravenous injection: **~1–2 min per mouse**
- Acute infection window: **days 0–15**
- Chronic infection window: **days 0–30+**

# Procedure

## Virus stock handling and preparation

LCMV-WE, LCMV-Clone 13, LCMV-Docile, and LCMV-Armstrong virus stocks are propagated and titrated as previously described in the literature and internal Abdullah Lab SOPs.

- Virus stocks are stored at **−80 °C** in single-use aliquots.
- Repeated freeze–thaw cycles must be avoided.

### Thawing

- Virus aliquots are **rapidly thawed immediately before use**.
- Thawing is performed in a **37 °C water bath** until the aliquot is just thawed.
- Aliquots are removed promptly from the water bath and placed **immediately on ice**.
- Virus is kept on ice during dilution and injection.
- Repeated freeze–thaw cycles must be avoided.

### Dilution buffer

- Virus stocks are diluted in **sterile, endotoxin-free PBS**.
- No serum or supplements are added unless explicitly required by internal SOP.
- Dilutions are prepared **fresh on the day of infection**.

## Infection doses and routes

Mice are infected **intravenously (i.v.)** via the lateral tail vein using the following Abdullah Lab standard doses:

- **LCMV-Clone 13:** **2 × 10⁶ plaque-forming units (PFU)**
- **LCMV-WE:** **2 × 10⁴ plaque-forming units (PFU)**

Other strains (Docile, Armstrong) are included for reference and comparative studies as outlined below.

### Injection parameters

- **Injection volume:** **200 µL per mouse**
- **Syringe:** insulin syringe
- **Needle gauge:** **27G–30G**
- Injections are performed slowly to ensure proper intravenous delivery.
- Successful i.v. injection is confirmed by lack of resistance and absence of subcutaneous bleb formation.

## Post-infection monitoring

- Body weight and general health are monitored daily during the first week post infection.
- Monitoring frequency is adjusted according to infection severity and institutional guidelines.
- Humane endpoints are applied as defined in approved protocols.

# Infection dose ranges, rationale, and expected outcomes

| Virus strain | Dose range (PFU, literature) | Rationale for low vs high dose | Expected outcome | Abdullah Lab standard |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Armstrong** | ~1 × 10⁴ – 2 × 10⁵ | Low–moderate dose to induce acute infection with rapid immune control | Acute infection; strong effector CD8 response; viral clearance and memory formation | Not standard |
| **WE** | ~1 × 10² – 1 × 10³ | Minimal acute infection | Rapid clearance; limited systemic and hepatic involvement | – |
|  | **2 × 10⁴** | Intermediate dose to ensure robust systemic infection without chronic persistence | Strong liver immune response; sustained NLC accumulation | **Yes** |
|  | ~1 × 10⁶ | High-dose systemic challenge used in comparative studies | Severe acute disease; heightened inflammation | No |
| **Clone 13** | **2 × 10⁶** | High antigen load to enforce chronic infection and exhaustion | Persistent infection; CD8 exhaustion program | **Yes** |
| **Docile** | ~1 × 10⁵ | Moderate dose allowing partial control | Semi-chronic infection; intermediate exhaustion | – |
|  | **2 × 10⁶** | High-dose infection to drive persistent antigen exposure | Chronic infection; exhaustion-prone immune response | **Yes** |

# Expected NLC dynamics in the liver

## LCMV-WE (2 × 10⁴ PFU i.v.)

- NLCs accumulate prominently in the liver.
- Peak frequency occurs at approximately **day 7 post infection**.
- Elevated NLC levels are **maintained through at least day 30 post infection**.
- This model supports **both early and long-term NLC analyses**.

## LCMV-Clone 13 (2 × 10⁶ PFU i.v.)

- NLCs peak **early**, around **day 5 post infection**.
- A **sharp contraction occurs by ~day 7**, followed by gradual decline through day 30.
- The effective experimental window for NLC analysis is **day 4–7 post infection**.
- Sampling outside this window will substantially underestimate NLC abundance.

# Experimental design guidance

- For studies requiring **broad or late NLC sampling**, LCMV-WE is preferred.
- For studies focused on **early inflammatory or antigen-rich environments**, Clone 13 is appropriate but requires tight temporal control.
- Direct comparisons between WE and Clone 13 must account for **non-overlapping NLC kinetics**.

# Safety (brief)

- All animal procedures must comply with approved animal licences and institutional regulations.
- Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection) when handling animals, tissues, and reagents.
- Handle sharps (needles, scalpels) with care and dispose of immediately in approved sharps containers.
- Perform virus handling, injections, and tissue processing in accordance with institutional biosafety guidelines.
- Dispose of viral waste and contaminated materials according to local biosafety regulations.
