**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This protocol describes a unified approach for **in vitro propagation of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)** strains commonly used in mouse infection models:

- LCMV **Armstrong (ARM)**
- LCMV **Clone 13 (Cl13)**
- LCMV **WE**
- LCMV **Docile** (WE-derived persistent variant)

The procedure is based primarily on *Welsh & Seedhom, Curr Protoc Microbiol 2008 (LCMV: Propagation, Quantitation, and Storage)* and adapted using production conditions reported in high-impact immunology studies (e.g. Recher *et al.*, Nat Med 2007; Bergthaler *et al.*, PNAS 2010; Macal *et al.*, Immunity 2018).

All strains are propagated on **fibroblast-like cell lines (BHK-21 or L929)** under BSL-2 conditions, with strain-specific preferences summarized below.

:::callout-warning
## LCMV biosafety and handling

LCMV is a zoonotic arenavirus capable of causing severe disease in humans, including meningitis and congenital infection. Work with live LCMV must:

- Be conducted under the appropriate institutional **biosafety level (typically BSL-2 with additional local conditions)** and approved animal and biosafety protocols.
- Use **dedicated infectious CO₂ incubators** and clearly labelled containment for all cultures and waste.
- Include suitable **PPE** (lab coat/gown, gloves, eye protection as appropriate) and measures to avoid sharps injuries, aerosol formation, and spills.
- Exclude or take special precautions for **pregnant or immunocompromised personnel** according to institutional policies.

All waste (liquid and solid) must be inactivated according to local regulations (e.g. chemical disinfection and/or autoclaving) **before** disposal.
:::

:::callout-warning
LCMV can cause meningitis and febrile illness in humans. Handle infectious material under BSL-2 conditions and according to your institutional biosafety guidelines.

# Strains and Recommended Producer Cell Lines

LCMV can grow in many adherent cell lines, but fibroblast/epithelial lines give the best yields. BHK-21 cells are the standard for most strains; WE and Docile are also frequently grown on L929 cells.

| Strain      | Phenotype in mice       | Parent strain | Preferred producer cell line(s) | Typical use |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Armstrong  | Acute, self-limited     | —            | **BHK-21** (also L929 possible) | Acute infection model |
| Clone 13   | Chronic systemic        | Armstrong    | **BHK-21** (sometimes L929/BHK) | Chronic infection, T cell exhaustion |
| WE         | Typically acute/visceral| WE           | **L929** or BHK-21              | Acute / hemorrhagic-like models |
| Docile     | Chronic / persistent    | WE           | **BHK-21** or L929              | Chronic WE-derived infection |

In practice:

- Use **BHK-21** as the default producer line for **Armstrong and Clone 13**.
- Use **L929** (or BHK-21) for **WE**.
- For **Docile**, follow the same protocol as WE; if unsure, start with BHK-21 and check titers.

# Overview of Workflow

1. Prepare producer cells (BHK-21 or L929) to the appropriate confluency.
2. Infect at low multiplicity of infection (MOI **0.01–0.1** infectious units per cell).
3. Allow virus to replicate **48–72 h** depending on strain and MOI.
4. Harvest and clarify virus-containing supernatant.
5. Aliquot and store at **−80 °C**.
6. Titrate by plaque assay (Vero cells) or focus-forming assay (MC57G or Vero).

# Materials

## Cell lines

- **BHK-21** (baby hamster kidney) cells
- **L929** (mouse fibroblast) cells
- Cell culture medium:
  - DMEM (or MEM for L929) + 10% heat-inactivated FBS
  - 1% Pen/Strep (optional; omit during infection, if desired)

## Virus

- Seed stocks of:
  - LCMV Armstrong
  - LCMV Clone 13
  - LCMV WE
  - LCMV Docile

## Reagents and consumables

- Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sterile
- Trypsin-EDTA
- 15 mL and 50 mL conical tubes
- 0.22 µm filters (optional, for final clarification if needed)
- Cryovials for viral aliquots
- Bleach (10% freshly prepared) and 70% ethanol for disinfection

## Equipment

- Class II biological safety cabinet (laminar flow hood)
- CO₂ incubator (37 °C, 5% CO₂)
- Tissue culture flasks (T25, T75, T175) or roller bottles
- Tabletop centrifuge capable of 300–500 × g at 4 °C
- Inverted microscope
- −80 °C freezer

# Producer Cell Preparation

1. Thaw BHK-21 or L929 cells and expand in complete medium until healthy and log-phase.
2. Seed flasks such that they reach the required confluency on the **day of infection**:
   - For infection, aim for **50–75% confluency** (Welsh & Seedhom; BHK-21 grow fast).
3. Maintain cells at 37 °C, 5% CO₂.

:::callout-tip
For high-titer preparations, it is better to infect slightly **subconfluent** (50–75%) rather than fully confluent monolayers.

# Infection Conditions by Strain

Use the following as starting conditions; fine-tune for your own cell lines and incubators.

| Strain      | Producer line | Suggested MOI (PFU/cell) | Typical harvest time | Expected titer (order of magnitude) |
|------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Armstrong  | BHK-21        | 0.01–0.1                 | 48 h                 | 10⁷–10⁸ PFU/mL                      |
| Clone 13   | BHK-21        | 0.05–0.1                 | 48–72 h              | 10⁷–10⁸ PFU/mL                      |
| WE         | L929 (or BHK) | 0.01–0.1                 | 48 h                 | 10⁶–10⁷ PFU/mL                      |
| Docile     | BHK-21/L929   | 0.01–0.1                 | 48–72 h              | 10⁶–10⁷ PFU/mL                      |

Notes:

- Lower MOI (0.01) with longer incubation (72 h) can yield slightly higher titers but risks more cell death and DI particle accumulation.
- For routine stocks, **MOI 0.05–0.1** and **48 h harvest** are a good compromise.

# Infection Procedure (All Strains)

The following steps apply to all four strains; choose the appropriate cell line and MOI per the table above.

1. **Prepare inoculum**
   - Thaw a virus aliquot rapidly at 37 °C and place immediately on ice.
   - Dilute virus in pre-warmed serum-containing medium to achieve the desired MOI in a minimal volume:
     - ~3–5 mL for a T75 flask
     - ~8–12 mL for a T175 flask

2. **Remove growth medium**
   - Aspirate medium from producer cell flasks.
   - Rinse once with room-temperature PBS (optional, especially if serum-free inoculum is used).

3. **Inoculate cells**
   - Add the virus inoculum to each flask.
   - Gently rock to distribute evenly.
   - Incubate **1 h at 37 °C**, rocking every 10–15 min.

4. **Add production medium**
   - After adsorption, top up with pre-warmed complete medium:
     - T75: total 15–20 mL
     - T175: total 30–40 mL
   - Return flasks to incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO₂.

5. **Incubation**
   - Monitor daily under the microscope.
   - Typical observations:
     - Slight rounding and increased refractility of cells by 24–48 h.
     - For Clone 13 and Docile, some strains show more pronounced cytopathic changes by 72 h.

6. **Harvest**
   - At the chosen timepoint (e.g. 48 h for most strains):
     - Gently tap flask to detach loosely adherent cells into the supernatant.
     - Transfer culture supernatant to 50 mL tubes on ice.

# Clarification and Aliquoting

1. Centrifuge collected supernatant at **300–500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C** to pellet cells and debris.
2. Carefully transfer clarified supernatant to new tubes.
3. Optional: pass through a **0.22 µm filter** if you require additional debris removal.
4. Aliquot into cryovials (e.g. 0.5–1.0 mL per vial).
5. Snap-freeze on dry ice or in an isopropanol freezing container and transfer to **−80 °C**.

:::callout-tip
Avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles. Use multiple small aliquots and thaw each only once.
:::

# Titration of Virus Stocks

- Determine infectious titer using **plaque assay on Vero cells** or **focus-forming assay on Vero or MC57G cells**.
- Record titers as PFU/mL (plaque assay) or FFU/mL (focus-forming assay).
- Use the same assay type consistently across experiments.

Separate Quarto protocols can be created for:

- **LCMV plaque assay on Vero cells**.
- **LCMV focus-forming assay (immunofocus) on MC57G or Vero cells**.


# Storage of LCMV Stocks

LCMV is a heat-labile enveloped virus and must be stored under conditions that preserve infectivity.

- Store viral stocks at **−70 to −80 °C**.
- Include a **protein stabilizer** (e.g., **10% FBS**) in the viral supernatant to improve freeze–thaw stability.
- Expect approximately **50% loss of titer with each freeze–thaw cycle**, even when protein is present.
- **Avoid repeated freeze–thawing** by preparing multiple small aliquots and using each vial only once.
- Highly purified, protein-poor virus preparations are **extremely unstable** on freeze–thaw unless the viral protein concentration is high enough to stabilize the envelope.
- When thawing an aliquot:
  - Thaw **rapidly at 37 °C**.
  - Immediately transfer the tube to **ice** and keep cold during all handling.

These practices minimize infectivity loss and ensure consistent titers across experiments.


# Troubleshooting

| Problem                    | Possible cause                                 | Suggested solution                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Very low titer            | Cells too confluent or unhealthy; MOI too low | Infect at 50–75% confluency; MOI 0.05–0.1; check cell line mycoplasma status |
| Massive cell detachment   | Infection too long or MOI too high            | Shorten incubation to 48 h; reduce MOI     |
| Inconsistent titers       | Variable cell density or incubation time      | Standardize seeding density and harvest time |
| Suspected contamination   | Poor aseptic technique                        | Review BSL-2 practices; discard contaminated stock and repeat |

# Strain-Specific Notes

## Armstrong

- Classical acute strain.
- Often propagated on BHK-21 cells at MOI 0.01–0.1 for 48 h.
- Frequently used to generate high-titer stocks for i.p. or i.v. infections in the 2 × 10⁵–2 × 10⁶ PFU range.

## Clone 13

- Armstrong-derived chronic strain with enhanced visceral tropism.
- Grows well on BHK-21 cells; titers similar to or slightly lower than Armstrong for the same MOI/time.
- For chronic infection models, typical i.v. doses are 2 × 10⁶ to 2 × 10⁷ PFU, depending on experimental design.

## WE

- WE strain is viscerotropic and often used as an acute systemic infection model.
- Commonly propagated on **L929 cells**, though BHK-21 also supports growth.
- For hemorrhagic-like disease models, stock quality and titer consistency are critical.

## Docile

- WE-derived persistent variant.
- Grows on BHK-21 and L929 cells; replication in vitro may be slightly slower than WE in some systems.
- Used for chronic infection models alternative to Clone 13.

# Safety considerations

- Confirm that all work with LCMV and infected animals/samples is covered by approved **biosafety and animal use protocols**.
- Perform all live-virus manipulations (thawing virus stocks, infection steps, handling of unfixed plates) in a **certified Class II biosafety cabinet**.
- Use **dedicated infectious incubators** and clearly label plates, flasks, and waste containers with the virus strain and date.
- Wear appropriate **PPE** at all times (lab coat/gown, gloves, eye/face protection as required).
- Decontaminate all liquid waste (e.g. with freshly prepared bleach) before disposal. Solid waste (tips, plates, tubes) must be autoclaved or otherwise inactivated according to institutional guidelines.
- OPD and its solutions are handled as **chemical hazardous waste**; follow chemical safety rules in addition to biosafety rules.
- Pregnant or immunocompromised personnel should not work with LCMV unless explicitly allowed under institutional policy with additional safeguards.
