**Protocol ID:** {{< meta protocol_id >}}  
**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino  

# Purpose

This protocol describes the rapid isolation of leukocytes from mouse spleen using mechanical dissociation, red blood cell lysis, and gentle washing steps. The resulting suspension is suitable for flow cytometry, sorting, and standard immunological assays.

# Critical notes (read before starting)

- Work on **ice** or at **4 °C** after dissociation to preserve viability.  
- **Do not reuse strainers** between spleens.  
- RBC lysis should be **time-limited (5 minutes)** to prevent leukocyte damage.  

# Approximate timing

- Dissection and spleen removal: **2–3 min**
- Mechanical dissociation: **2–3 min**
- RBC lysis: **5 min**
- Final wash and resuspension: **5 min**

Total hands-on time per spleen: **15–20 minutes**.

# Procedure

## STEP 1 – Collection and preparation

1. Euthanise the mouse by an approved method.  
2. Expose the spleen by opening the abdominal cavity.  
3. Excise the spleen and remove connective tissue & adipose tissue
4. Place it into a petri dish or 15 mL Falcon tube containing **cold PBS or FACS Buffer**.

## STEP 2 – Mechanical dissociation

1. Place a **70 µm cell strainer** over a **50 mL Falcon tube**.  
2. Transfer the spleen onto the strainer.  
3. Using the **back of a 5 mL syringe plunger**, gently mash the spleen through the mesh until a homogenous suspension is obtained.  
4. Rinse the strainer with **FACS Buffer** and top the tube up to **50 mL**.

::: callout-note
Max of 2 spleens per tube/strainer
:::

## STEP 3 – Wash and centrifugation

1. Centrifuge the 50 mL tube at **400 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C**.  
2. Carefully pour off the supernatant.

## STEP 4 – RBC lysis

1. Add **1 mL HybriMax RBC Lysis Buffer** (or equivalent) **per spleen** to the pellet.  
2. Gently resuspend the pellet by pipetting or flicking.  
3. Incubate for **5 minutes at room temperature**.  
4. Top up to **50 mL** with **FACS Buffer**.

::: callout-warning
Avoid over-lysis (>5 minutes) as this can reduce leukocyte viability.

## STEP 5 – Filtration and final wash

1. Filter the suspension through a **fresh 70 µm strainer** into a clean tube.  
2. Centrifuge at **400 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C**.  
3. Carefully discard supernatant.  
4. Resuspend the pellet in **5 mL FACS Buffer** (or a volume appropriate for your downstream assay).

## STEP 6 – Downstream handling

Proceed immediately to:

- Flow cytometry staining  
- FACS sorting  
- Cryopreservation  
- Functional assays  

Keep cells **on ice** until use.

# Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible cause | Suggested solution |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Low cell yield | Incomplete mechanical dissociation | Spend additional time mashing through mesh |
| Excess debris | Over-aggressive mashing | Apply gentler pressure |
| Poor viability | Prolonged room-temperature handling | Keep samples cold; minimise processing time |
| Pellets lost | Pouring too forcefully | Use slow, controlled decanting |

# Safety (brief)

- Process mouse tissues according to S1/S2 guidelines and ethics approval.  
- RBC lysis buffer contains toxic reagents — wear PPE and avoid inhalation or skin contact.  
- Dispose of biological material and sharps appropriately.
