title: "Onboarding"
---

## Purpose

This section contains all information required for onboarding new PhD students joining the lab.

It is intended to:
- Provide a clear onboarding pathway
- Define expectations and standards
- Centralise practical information needed to work effectively in the lab and institute

This section complements (but does not replace) lab protocols and experimental SOPs.

## How to use this section

### New PhD students
1. Start with the **Onboarding checklist**
2. Complete mandatory items in the first weeks
3. Use the remaining pages as reference material

### Supervisors and lab members
- Use this section as the canonical reference for onboarding
- Avoid duplicating onboarding instructions elsewhere
- Update pages here rather than sharing ad hoc documents

## Scope and boundaries

This onboarding section:
- Describes **what exists** and **what is expected**
- Links to protocols and SOPs where appropriate

It does **not**:
- Contain experimental protocols
- Replace safety or ethics training
- Serve as a troubleshooting guide for experiments

---

## Questions or missing information

If information is missing or unclear:
- First, check whether it exists elsewhere in the documentation
- If not, raise it with your supervisor or a senior lab member so it can be added here

This onboarding documentation is intended to evolve with the lab.
