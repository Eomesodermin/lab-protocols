## Purpose

This page provides an overview of **core facilities** used by IMMEI research groups and the Abdullah Lab.

It is intended to help new PhD students:
- Understand which facilities exist
- Know who to contact for access and training
- Navigate required inductions and introductions

This page describes **what facilities exist and how to access them**, not how to perform experiments.

## Flow Cytometry Core Facility (FCCF)

The **Flow Cytometry Core Facility (FCCF)** provides flow cytometry analysis, high-parameter acquisition, and cell sorting services to IMMEI and the wider Medical Faculty.

### Access and training

Before using any FCCF instruments, users must:
- Arrange an **induction and training**
- Be approved for independent instrument use (where applicable)

**Primary contact for induction and training:**  
**Andreas Dolf**

New users should contact Andreas Dolf early during onboarding to:
- Schedule an introduction
- Discuss training requirements
- Clarify which instruments are appropriate for their project

### Available instrumentation (overview)

The FCCF hosts a range of flow cytometers and sorters, including:
- Multi-laser analyzers for high-parameter flow cytometry
- High-speed cell sorters suitable for:
  - Immune cell sorting
  - Rare population isolation
  - Downstream functional and molecular assays

Specific instrument availability, configurations, and booking procedures are maintained by the FCCF and may change over time.

### FCCF staff

The FCCF is supported by dedicated technical and scientific staff who:
- Provide user training
- Support experimental planning
- Assist with complex sorting and analysis tasks

Users are encouraged to engage with FCCF staff when planning demanding or non-standard experiments.

### Further information

Official FCCF information, updates, and contact details are available at:

## Animal facility

Animal work is conducted through the **central animal facility** at the University Hospital Bonn.

### Access and introduction

To obtain access:
- Contact **Daniela Krauss**
- Arrange required introductions and approvals
- Complete any mandatory inductions before starting animal work

### Mouse management

- Mouse colonies and experimental records are managed using **PyRAT**
- All mouse work must be recorded according to facility and institutional requirements

Animal work must comply with all ethical approvals, institutional rules, and national regulations.
