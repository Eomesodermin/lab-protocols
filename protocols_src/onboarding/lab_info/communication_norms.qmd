## Purpose

This document defines **how communication works** in the Abdullah Lab.

Clear communication supports:
- Efficient day-to-day work
- Productive supervision
- Early identification of problems
- A respectful and professional lab culture

These norms apply to **all lab members**.

---

## General principles

- Communicate clearly and proactively
- Choose the appropriate channel for the topic
- Share information that affects others
- Raise issues early rather than letting them accumulate

---

## Communication channels

### Mattermost (day-to-day communication)

**Mattermost is the primary platform for day-to-day lab communication.**

Use Mattermost for:
- Quick questions
- Coordination (e.g. equipment, schedules)
- Short updates
- Announcements relevant to the lab

Keep messages concise and considerate of others’ time.

---

### Email (formal and external communication)

Use email for:
- Formal communication
- Administrative matters
- Communication with external collaborators
- Topics requiring a clear written record

Avoid using email for rapid back-and-forth discussion when Mattermost is more appropriate.

---

## Meetings

### Supervisor meetings

- PhD students are expected to have **regular supervisor meetings**
- Meetings are typically **weekly or biweekly**, as agreed with the supervisor
- Frequency and format may evolve over the course of the PhD

### Preparing for meetings

To make meetings effective:
- Prepare key updates in advance
- Identify questions or decisions that require input
- Bring figures or data when relevant

Meetings work best when both sides arrive prepared.

---

### Group meetings and discussions

- Participate actively and respectfully
- Ask questions and contribute constructively
- Provide feedback focused on the science

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Important decisions or outcomes should be:
- Documented (e.g. notes, shared documents)
- Reflected in project plans or records
- Followed up where action is required

Verbal agreements should be written down if they affect timelines, responsibilities, or experimental direction.

---

## Raising issues and concerns

If you encounter problems:
- Scientific (e.g. experiments not working)
- Organisational (e.g. access, resources)
- Interpersonal (e.g. communication difficulties)

Raise them early.

Where appropriate:
- Start with direct discussion
- Involve a supervisor or senior lab member if needed

The goal is resolution and progress, not blame.

---

## Disagreements and feedback

- Scientific disagreement is normal and expected
- Discuss differences professionally and respectfully
- Focus on data and reasoning rather than individuals

Feedback should be constructive and aimed at improving outcomes.

---

## Scope and limitations

This document:
- Defines **how communication is handled**
- Supports efficient collaboration

It does **not**:
- Replace institutional policies
- Define performance evaluation
- Specify response-time guarantees

---

## Notes

These communication norms may evolve as the lab grows.  
If something is unclear or not working well, raise it so expectations can be adjusted.
