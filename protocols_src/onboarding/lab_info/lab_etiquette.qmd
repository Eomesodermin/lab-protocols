## Purpose

This document describes **day-to-day lab etiquette** in the Abdullah Lab.

Its goal is to:
- Prevent avoidable friction
- Ensure shared spaces remain functional
- Make expectations explicit rather than assumed

These guidelines apply to **all lab members** and complement the broader principles described in *Lab Expectations*.

---

## General principle

The lab is a **shared working environment**.

A simple rule applies:
> Leave spaces, equipment, and reagents in a state that you would be happy to find them.

---

## Benches and workspaces

### Bench use
- Keep benches as clear as possible
- Only keep materials required for current work on the bench
- Return shared items when finished

### End of day expectations
At the end of the day:
- Dispose of waste appropriately
- Wipe down the bench if work involved spills or biological material
- Return equipment and reagents to their designated locations

Benches should not accumulate long-term storage or unused items.

---

## Shared equipment

### General use
- Treat shared equipment with care
- Follow posted instructions and lab norms
- Do not modify settings without understanding the impact on others

### After use
- Clean equipment if required
- Reset settings if you changed them
- Report malfunctions or damage promptly

If equipment is left unusable, the next user is delayed.

---

## Fridges, freezers, and storage

### Labelling
All stored items must be clearly labelled with:
- Name or initials
- Contents
- Date

Unlabelled or outdated items may be removed during clean-ups.

### Organisation
- Respect designated areas and shelves
- Do not move or discard others’ samples without discussion
- Avoid overcrowding shared storage

---

## Reagents and consumables

- Close containers properly
- Do not return contaminated reagents to stock
- Inform the lab if common reagents are running low
- Do not use unlabelled or expired reagents

If unsure about a reagent’s status, ask before using it.

---

## Tissue culture areas

- Follow sterile technique consistently
- Clean work areas before and after use
- Dispose of waste correctly
- Do not leave flasks or plates without clear labelling

Tissue culture spaces must be kept especially orderly to protect all users.

---

## Booking and fairness

Where equipment or space is shared:
- Be considerate of others’ time
- Cancel bookings you do not need
- Avoid monopolising resources

If you need extended or unusual access, communicate this in advance.

---

## Noise, interruptions, and shared space awareness

- Be mindful of noise levels in shared areas
- Keep phone calls and meetings from disrupting others
- Respect that others may be concentrating or running time-sensitive experiments

---

## Food, drink, and personal items

- Follow safety rules regarding food and drink in lab areas
- Keep personal items out of experimental spaces
- Store food only in designated areas

---

## Problems, mistakes, and accountability

Mistakes happen.

If something goes wrong:
- Inform relevant lab members promptly
- Do not hide problems or hope they go unnoticed
- Work collaboratively to resolve issues

Early communication prevents small problems from becoming larger ones.

---

## Scope

This document focuses on **practical etiquette**, not:
- Scientific judgement
- Performance evaluation
- Institutional policy

When in doubt, default to **clear communication and consideration for others**.

---

## Notes

These guidelines reflect current lab practice and may evolve.  
Suggestions for improvement are welcome and should be raised so expectations remain clear and fair.
