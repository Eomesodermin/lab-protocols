## Purpose

This document outlines the **shared expectations** for all members of the Abdullah Lab.

Its purpose is to:
- Provide clarity on how the lab functions day to day
- Set common standards for conduct, communication, and responsibility
- Support a professional, respectful, and productive research environment

These expectations apply to **all lab members**, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, technicians, and visiting researchers.

---

## General principles

The Abdullah Lab values:
- Scientific integrity and reproducibility
- Mutual respect and professionalism
- Open communication
- Shared responsibility for the lab environment

Expectations are framed to support independence while ensuring that work remains transparent, collaborative, and reproducible.

---

## Professional conduct

Lab members are expected to:
- Treat colleagues with respect at all times
- Communicate constructively, even in disagreement
- Be reliable and follow through on agreed tasks
- Contribute positively to the lab environment

Discriminatory, dismissive, or unprofessional behaviour is not acceptable.  
Concerns should be raised early, either directly or via a supervisor, before issues escalate.

---

## Scientific integrity and documentation

All work conducted in the lab must meet high standards of scientific integrity.

Expectations include:
- Experiments are planned thoughtfully and documented clearly
- Data are recorded contemporaneously and accurately
- Deviations from protocols are noted
- Data and reagents are traceable

Lab members must follow the lab’s **Data Management and Reproducibility Standards**, including:
- Use of experiment IDs
- Consistent file and folder naming
- Appropriate data storage
- Clear reagent labelling

Both **paper and electronic lab notebooks are acceptable**, provided records are complete, legible, and up to date.

---

## Communication norms

### Day-to-day communication

- **Mattermost** is the primary platform for day-to-day lab communication
- Use Mattermost for quick questions, coordination, and updates
- Email should be used for formal communication, external contacts, or administrative matters

### Meetings

- PhD students are expected to have **regular supervisor meetings**, typically **weekly or biweekly**, as agreed with their supervisor
- Lab members should come prepared to meetings with:
  - Key updates
  - Questions or points requiring input
  - Relevant figures or data when appropriate

Meeting frequency and format may evolve over time and should be revisited as projects progress.

---

## Ownership and responsibility

Lab members are expected to take ownership of their work.

This includes responsibility for:
- Experimental planning and execution
- Proper documentation and data storage
- Maintenance of personal reagents and samples
- Cleaning up after experiments
- Following up on results and action items

Asking for help is encouraged, particularly when blocked or uncertain.  
Waiting too long to raise issues can slow progress and create avoidable problems.

---

## Shared resources and lab citizenship

The lab relies on shared resources, including equipment, reagents, and space.

Expectations include:
- Leaving shared equipment clean and ready for the next user
- Returning reagents and consumables to their correct location
- Clearly labelling personal materials
- Reporting broken equipment, low stock, or safety issues promptly

Good lab citizenship is essential for a functional and supportive environment.

---

## Safety and compliance

All lab members must:
- Follow applicable safety regulations and institutional requirements
- Complete required inductions (e.g. S2, iFET) before performing relevant work
- Adhere to animal facility rules when applicable

If unsure about safety or compliance, lab members are expected to **pause work and ask**.  
No experiment is urgent enough to justify unsafe practices.

---

## Expectations around supervision

Supervision is a shared responsibility.

Supervisors commit to:
- Regular meetings and availability for discussion
- Clear communication of priorities and expectations
- Constructive feedback on data and progress
- Support in training, troubleshooting, and career development
- Guidance on publications, presentations, and PhD milestones

Lab members are encouraged to communicate openly about challenges, workload, and progress.

---

## Raising issues and resolving problems

If issues arise (scientific, organisational, or interpersonal):
- Raise them early
- Where possible, discuss directly with the relevant person
- If needed, involve a supervisor or senior lab member

The goal is resolution, not blame.

---

## Scope and limitations

This document:
- Describes **how the lab operates**
- Sets shared expectations and norms

It does **not**:
- Replace institutional policies
- Override safety regulations
- Define employment contracts

---

## Notes

These expectations are intended to evolve with the lab.  
Suggestions for improvement or clarification are welcome and should be raised so this document remains accurate and useful.
