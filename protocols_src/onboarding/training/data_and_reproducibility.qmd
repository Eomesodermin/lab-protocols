**Version:** {{< meta version >}}  
**Author:** Dillon Corvino

## Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory standards** for data management and reproducibility in the Abdullah Lab.

These standards ensure that:
- Experiments can be understood and reproduced by others
- Data remain interpretable over time
- Projects can be transferred without loss of context
- Reagents and materials are traceable

All lab members are expected to follow these standards.

---

## Guiding principles

- Clarity over convenience
- Consistency across the lab
- One experiment → one clear identifier
- Raw data are never altered
- Physical labels must match digital records

---

## Experiment identifiers

Every experiment must have a **unique experiment ID**.

### Approved formats

Experiment IDs must follow **one of the following formats**:

```
<initials><YY>_<NN>
<initials><NN>
```

Where:
- `<initials>` = experimenter initials (e.g. DC)
- `<YY>` = two-digit year (e.g. 25)
- `<NN>` = sequential experiment number

### Examples

```
DC25_01
DC25_02
DC01
DC02
```

The experiment ID must be used consistently across:
- Folder names
- File names
- Lab notebook entries
- Analysis scripts

---

## File and folder naming

### General rules

- Lowercase letters only
- Underscores (`_`) only
- No spaces or special characters
- Avoid vague terms such as:
  - `final`
  - `new`
  - `test`

### Recommended folder structure

```
experiment_id/
├── raw/
├── processed/
├── analysis/
├── figures/
└── notes/
```

### File naming

Files should **almost always include the experiment ID** to ensure traceability outside the original folder context.

The experiment ID should appear at the **start of the filename**, followed by a short descriptive suffix.

**Examples**
```
DC25_01_gating_strategy.pdf
DC25_01_analysis.wsp
DC25_01_cell_counts.xlsx
DC25_01_analysis_notes.md
```

Files that do not include the experiment ID should be the exception and must still be unambiguous in context.

## Approved data storage locations

### Sciebo (approved primary storage)

**Sciebo is the approved storage location for lab data.**

Use Sciebo for:
- Raw experimental data
- Processed data
- Analysis outputs
- Shared documents

### Local machines

- Allowed **temporarily only**
- Raw data must be transferred to Sciebo promptly
- Local machines must not be the sole copy of data

### Prohibited storage

- Personal cloud services (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox)
- USB sticks as primary or long-term storage

---

## Raw vs processed data

### Raw data

- Must remain unmodified
- Must retain original file formats
- Must be stored in a dedicated `raw/` directory

### Processed data

- Stored separately from raw data
- Processing steps must be documented
- Script-based processing is preferred

---

## Reagent labelling standards

All reagents must be clearly labelled at the time of preparation or opening.

### Required information on reagent labels

Each reagent container must include:
- Reagent name **or** initials / identifier
- Sterile or non-sterile status
- Date opened or prepared
- Initials of the person who prepared/opened it

Unlabelled or ambiguously labelled reagents must not be used.

---

## Viral stocks

Viral stocks must be labelled with sufficient information to ensure traceability.

### Recommended format

```
virus_strain_passage_YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Example**
```
lcmv_we_p3_2025-02-10
```

Records must include:
- Source
- Passage number
- Storage location

---

## Cell lines

Cell lines must be labelled in a **similar manner to viral stocks**, ensuring traceability.

### Required information

Cell line labels must include:
- Cell line name
- Passage number
- Date
- Initials

**Example**
```
jurkat_p18_2025-03-04_DC
```

A master record should document:
- Cell line source
- Genetic modifications (if any)
- Thaw date and passage history

---

## Tissue culture flask labelling

All tissue culture flasks must be clearly labelled.

### Required information on flasks

- Cell line name
- Passage number
- Date
- Media used
- Initials

**Example**
```
jurkat | p18 | 2025-03-04 | dmem+penstrep+neaas | DC
```

---

## Media and reagent modifications

Any modification to base media must be recorded.

### Requirements

- Record all additives (e.g. antibiotics, supplements)
- Use consistent shorthand
- Ensure the formulation is documented digitally

### Example

```
DMEM + Pen/Strep + NEAAs
```

If media composition differs from standard lab formulations, this must be clearly documented.

---

## Record keeping

At minimum, records for each experiment must include:
- Experiment ID
- Date
- Operator
- Biological material
- Reagents used
- Deviations from protocol

Electronic or paper lab notebooks are acceptable, but records must be complete and legible.

---

## Versioning

- Use sequential versions: `v1`, `v2`, `v3`
- Major changes require a new version
- Deprecated data or reagents must not be deleted without discussion

---

## Responsibilities

- Each experimenter is responsible for compliance
- Supervisors may review organisation and records
- Issues should be corrected promptly when identified

---

## Notes

These standards are living guidelines and may evolve.  
Any ambiguities or gaps should be raised so this document can be updated.
